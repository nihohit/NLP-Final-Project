<h2>Songs Genres Classification<h2>
<p>Today, we usually define a song’s genre by its vocal elemnts – melody, instruments, etc.</p>
<p>We intend to find if we can define a genre simply through the lyrics – whether the written elements of songs contain significant genre information. </p>

<h2>Why ?</h2>
<h4>Because its AWESOME!</h4>
<p>
	Also, this is important to the study of literature and poetry – it could hint at a cognitive connection between melodies and ideas, and help us define the term “genre” and its meanings, thus grounding the study of literature and poetry in something a bit more robust than just personal taste and opinion. 
</p>

<h2>How? Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables.

</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Words – we’ll examine how distinct is the vocabulary of each genre.</p>
<p>Structure – if time constraints will allow, we’ll examine whether genres also imply a certain structure on the lyrics.</p>
<p>Diversity – even if genres use the same words, do they repeat themselves (“Baby, baby, baby oooh”), or does each song contain a wider selection of words?</p>

<h2>Limitations and Future Enhancements</h2>
<p>Lyrics databases aren’t quality-controlled, don’t carry the same formats between songs (especially obvious with “censored” words, which can be written in different ways – S-it, Sh*t, *%#$, etc.)
No existing tree-banks on song lyrics, which limits us to low-level analysis.
No efficient data-mining tools – either we create them, or we hand-create all of our data-sets.
