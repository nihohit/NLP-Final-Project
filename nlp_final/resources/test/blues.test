# 1 Billie Holiday Please, Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone 
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice
We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice
We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

# 2 Bessie Smith A Good Man Is Hard To Find 
My heart's sad and I am all forlorn, my man's treating me mean
I regret the day that I was born and that man of mine I've ever seen
Happiness, it never lasts a day, my heart is almost breaking while I say
A good man is hard to find, you always get the other kind
Just when you think that he is your pal, you look for him and find him
Fooling 'round some other gal
Then you rave, you even crave to see him laying in his grave
So, if your man is nice, take my advice and hug him in the morning, kiss
Him every night,
Give him plenty lovin', treat him right
For a good man nowadays is hard to find, a good man nowadays is hard to
Find

# 3 Memphis Minnie I Hate To See The Sun Go Down
I hate to see evenin' sun go down
I hate to see evenin' sun go down
Cause it makes me think, I'm on my last go-round
Some people take the blues, go jump overboard and drown
Some people take the blues, go jump overboard and drown
But when they gets on me, I'd rather stay 'n go sit down
I been to the river, looked it up and down
I been to the river, looked it up and down
But when my mind never let me, to jump overboard and drown
Oh take it away now...
Yes I know...
Play it mister Charlie...
While I'm lookin' at you...
Every time I go, across that old muddy pond
Every time I go, across that old muddy pond
I think about my baby, and come easin' on back home
Everybody try to show me, how to ease my troublin' mind
Everybody try to show me, how to ease my troublin' mind
When the big boat come along, to just jump on in behind

# 4 Bukka White Good Gin Blues
Here come old Todd Walker, full-a his good gin.
Good mornin' friend
I wants a drink of gin
Good mornin' friend
I wants a drink of gin
'Cause they told me this mornin'
Revenue men be back, again
Oh, listen you men
Don't you let him in
Listen, you men
Don't you let him in
Well, they might catch me
Or I'll wait up for him, again
Oh, come in friend
And have a drink a gin
Come in friend
And have a drink a gin
Now, I know he deserves sin
But I love my good old gin
Oh, come back friend
When I ain't in my gin
Come back friend
When I ain't in my gin
'Cause I don't care nothin' about
Oh, them old revenue men, now. 

# 5 John Lee Hooker Country Boy
I ain't nothin' but a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
I ain't nothin' but a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
Got no place, ooh yeah
To call my home
Sometime in travellin'
I travel when nights are blue
Sometime my night
My night so dark and blue
But I keep on travellin'
No place to lay my worried head
I'm just a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
Driftin' from town to town
I ain't got no place
To lay my worried head, baby
Sometime I lay down on the highway
I cry to take my rest
I hear a freight train howlin'
I drown my head and run
I'm just a country boy
Driftin' from town to town, have mercy
Now one night I was travellin'
I saw a light in the winter
I was so cold at night
And my clothes were soakin' wet
I walked on to the door
I knocked on the door
A little girl come to the door
She said, "Mister, what do you want"
I said, "It's cold outside, baby"
She looked at me and said
"Come on in, I wanna talk to you"
I got a brother who left home
He was twelve years old
Just like the prodigal son
I know you'd find him
