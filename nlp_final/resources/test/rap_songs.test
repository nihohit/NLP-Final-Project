# 1 MACKLEMORE & RYAN LEWIS - CANT HOLD US 
Return of the Mack get up
What it is what it does what it is what it isnt
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
We get up fresh out pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby Sweater Gang
Nope Nope yall cant copy that
Bad moonwalkin This here is our party
My posses been on broadway and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet Im on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money
Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my INDEPENDENT shit hustling
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the 4 track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack fat cat crush shit
Labels out here nah they cant tell me nothing
We give it to the people spread it across the country
Labels out here nah they cant tell me nothing
We give it to the people spread it across the country
And then we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us
Now can I kick it Thank you
Yeah Im so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But thats what you get when Wu Tang raised you
Yall cant stop me I go hard like Ive got an 808 in my heart beat
And Im eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Why Time to go off Gone Deuces goodbye
Ive got a world to see;
And my girl She wanna see Rome
Caesarll make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So Im giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like
Raise those hands this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me;
If I fall they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility
Then we keep marching I said
And all my people say
Na na NAna na naNA na

Monogamy or whatever you call it
 Im starting to think it aint for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways you know what Im saying
You aint rushing for love and I aint up here to judge

She take pride in going out
 Getting hollered at and saying nah

She dont wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She dont really date much but it slows her up
She got haters but we all do
Heard you winter time cold shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
 All those minds games nevermind cause they all lose
 In the physical sense I mean that
I aint tryna kiss up suck up feed gas

# 13 KENDRICK LAMAR - BITCH DON’T KILL MY VIBE 
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me thats amazing
To you thats a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co sign what radio does
And Im looking right past ya
We live in a world we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to
This shit is vital I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name Ill let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Im a break out and then hide every lock
Im a break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me thats amazing
To you thats a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
You aint heard a chorus like this in a long time
Dont you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3s in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings hide your feelings now what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My new years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much I got my drink I got my music
I say - Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe

 Billionaire nigga no rumor
 Livin my life off of tuna
 Wanted with me I deliver the beef
 Real niggas only enjoyin the feast
 Pull up a seat bon appetite
 No lou Vuittons put that red on your feet Bang

 Is why they hatin push a button on these broke boys
 Its detonation walk a road to riches bare feet
 I watch mama struggle now she livin care free
 Thats why I hustle for half a Ki thats 12 Gs
 Im tryin to bubble every summer out in LP

 Signin bonuses get that red from dirty feet
 Left in a puddle finger prints is on hundred mill
 And what it is Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood

# 19 2 CHAINZ  WE OWN IT FAST & FURIOUS 
Moneys the motivation moneys the conversation
You on vacation We gettin paid so
We on paycation I did it for the fam
Its whatever we had to do its just who I am
Yeah its the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion thanks for asking
Couldnt slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic we bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon pass
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me now Im
One shot everything rides on tonight
Even if Ive got three strikes
Imma go for it
This moment we own it
And Im not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment we own it
And the same ones that I ride with,
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with,
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad Im down with

Working hard reppin for my dogs do this everyday,
Takin off looking out for all makin sure we ball,
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall Young Khalifa
I ride or die for love
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns been graduated from knives
Its the day in the life and Im ready to ride
Got the spirit Im feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak Im free but I aint out yet
Ridin with the plug so Im close to the outlet
At the red light rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit
Stuck to the plan always think that we would stand up never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem I got the same one
Money rolls we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs our cars dont even lose control

# 20 NICKI MINAJ - HIGH SCHOOL SINGLE 
He said he came from Jamaica he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm baby mother tatted
5 year bid up north on they ratted
Anyway I felt him helped him put him on lock seat belt them
Took him out to Belgium welcome
Bitches this pretty thats seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
Im Momma Dee in that order I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk but I like it when he be sober
Thats top of the toppa I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
Im in the zone
They holler at me but its you
You this aint high school
Me and my crew
We can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby its yours
Anywhere everywhere
Baby its your world
Aint it

Lil Tune

# 21 Soulja Slim Im A Fool
 So Slim do you have anything to say to the people

You fuckin with the right one soulja fo life one
Aint no mothafucka like em
Where he at show em to me
And Im gonna strike em and bite em
And swallow em for trying to be a follower
My deadly venom instantly kills em like a cobra
Leave it up to Magnolia
To shut em down and sober
Popped off and tokin em
Break down and stick em and hold em up
And smoke it up with enemies
Claim to be friends with me
The whole while they into me
When shit dont make sense to me
Whodi got a bently and whodi got a jag
Whodi got a lot of shit that Soulja Slim never had
But I dont get mad and start hatin cuz thats bitch shit
If it wasnt for incarceration Id a been rich

And Im one of em who likes to talk about what Im about
Straight up tell ya to ya face what Im gonna do

I can hear em sayin it now
Thats a fool there a fool there
Whos there its me dog me 
Where the fuck you was at when I was off in the penetentiary
When I was outta sight and outta mind
With only a handful of soldiers by my side 
Rest of my so called niggas was jive
But I aint gonna say no names cuz they know who they be
So if you thinkin Im talkin bout you Fuck You
Cuz lately I been feelin since these niggas tryin soulja hate me
That they wanna duct tape me
And knock me off and drop me off in the Nolia
But Im shell shocked clutchin my glock bitch Im a soldier 
Beggin around fo some change and come and get me
And Im gonna be waitin on em by myself with my pistols with me
Aint nann nigga gon ride like Im gon ride for me
And aint nann nigga gon die like Im gon die for me
Believe that Im 100% real when ya look me up and down
You can see that come back in the mix and Ill be back
To touch somethin hit somethin and split somethin
Quit stunnin yall niggas aint killin nuttin
Im a fool
I been there done that shit
When Im off in that zone nigga tell me run that shit
Im a fool
Angola bound uptown
Skinny ass nigga weighin a hundred somethin pounds
Im a fool
I represents what I say
Aint no fuckin game here aint no instant replay
Im a fool
I hear em sayin it now thats a fool there a fool there
 Slim do you have anything to say to the haters who say you cant
Make it on the outside  
Remember this old sayin a wise man change
A fool will stay the same
Fuck it blame it on the game
Breakin acid
Will I spend my life in a cell block or in a casket
Or will I get old and get my groove back like Angela Basset
Only time will tell but until then Ill be stackin my mail
By album album sells Magnolia wear dwells
I love them bricks I love the ghetto hoes
Cuz they gon show ya what they workin with
A lot of my little dogs still be gettin loaded
Walkin around the project with the pistol out talkin and snortin
Whodi dont give a fuck cuz they dealer got em gone
Bout that foolishness and gon jack somethin with they jones
They remind me of me old Magnolia Slim
You can break ya ass off in this sewer water tryin to swim
Its polluted Im foolish

# 22 Dj Quik Murda 1 Case 
I had to figure out a way to touch em
Expose the money and hoes had to rush em
Six by nine Pioneers up in my Cutlass
So I can bump N W A and my tape - fuck it 
Gots to work to add to my little paper
Need a boost so I gots to pull me some capers
Circulate the dollar pull a broad I aint the type to drape her
She roll and she real - if not I got to shake her
Or turn her mind to the next page face 
Face fears fuck drama lets get paid paid 
Business first then well crack a spot so we can play
In the cut somewhere with some drink out the way
Now KK is the name no actin just mackin
Without runnin some game together we can stack it
Yall niggaz fuckin with the original raspy
Haters talk shit and they split;
Not knowin that they rolled right past me
I aint nervous - Im lookin for plot for a debt thats overdue
Hangin out the window of the rental we dumpin over you
We do walk-bys skip-bys bicycle-bys
Waterhose-douse-bys bush-in-front-ya-house-bys yes 
Bein a rider is more than sound effects
With wires wrapped round ya neck you know the sound thats next 
With a twist snap you fall
We duct-tapin your wrists ankles laps and all
We love that Goodfellas Scarface all that mafia stuff
But a few volumes of Faces of Death get you coppin it tough
Look at the autopsy where fly-swatters got mashed for miles
Writin checks that they insides couldnt cash ewww 
Like raw steak them vital organs they soft
Pharoahe Monch and K like chrome they popped off
Chunky to wicked and me yeah Quik did it
The murder the mayhem like 40 we SicWidIt 
What the fuck do we have here 
Pharoahe Monch lets make one thing clear
Forget the tiger I admire the eye of the bull
Spit it for the critics and the undesirables
Quik beats bang like street gangs in inner city
I Bang- like -ladesh plus bang like shit aint shitty
Shitty sell fake Gucci bags on eBay
So advanced when I rhyme that you need time de-lay
These three and up company like Jack Tripper
To get in Depp like Johnny but not Jack the Ripper
Tripped ya the slumpture slasher
Will rupture yout whole team and abduct your church pastor
You know you gotta get it from the incredible mastermind
With disastrous raps hard to find or follow
The motto - DJ Quik shit
Hit mo frequently than quick-pick lotto
