# 2 Stone Temple Pilots Black Again
When you're fed up and lonely
And nothing else seems to matter really
I'll be here waiting for the
Black cloud to leave you
I'll be here to hold your hand
When you're tired and lonely
Hold your breath underwater
And know you'll rise to the
Surface slowly
Think of me as a ship that might hold you
Carry you to the shore
When you're tired and lonely
She can't eat
She can't sleep
She's not well she's lonely again
She can't breathe
She's in bed
She's in hell
But she'll never
Really be alone
As long as I'm beside her

# 3 Soundgarden Drawing Flies
Flies
Flies
Sitting here like uninvited company
Wallowing in my own obscenities
I share a cigarette with negativity
Sitting here like wet ashes with X's in my eyes
And drawing flies
Bathed in perspiration drowned my enemies
Used my inspiration on a guillotine
I fire a loaded mental cannon to the page
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes with X's in my eyes
And drawing flies
And I said Hey what you yelling about
Conditions permission mirrored self affliction
Hey what you yelling about
Sadists' co addiction perfect analogies
Hey what you yelling about
Conditions permission mirrored self affliction
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes with X's in my eyes
And drawing flies
Flies
Sitting here like uninvited company
Wallowing in my own obscenities
I share a cigarette with negativity
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes with X's in my eyes
And drawing flies
Flies flies flies flies flies flies flies flies flies

# 4 Smashing Pumpkins The Celestials
On the day that you were born
They built an empire off a scream
I can't explain
Endlessly they'll set you free
Give you reason to believe
This empty place
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
I'm gonna love you 101 percent
I'm gonna love you til this ends
Take a chance if you should go
Face upon your happy home
The scanners wait
Selfishly they might concede
You were always on your own
You can't escape
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
You're not me and never ever will you be
I'm gonna find you and never run against
I'm gonna find you til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even while their numbers call you out
Everything I want is free
Free you're free with me
You're free with me

# 5 Bruce Springsteen Born In The U S A
Born down in a dead man town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering up
Born in the usa I was born in the usa
I was born in the usa born in the usa
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the USA
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man said son if it was up to me
Went down to see my va man
He said son don't you understand
I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go
Born in the usa I was born in the usa
Born in the usa I'm a long gone daddy in the usa
Born in the usa born in the usa
Born in the usa I'm a cool rocking daddy in the usa

# 6 Aerosmith Love Three Times A Day
Hello Hello Hello Come on come on come over
Hello Hello Hello Until the storm blows over
Love three times a day
Love your life away
Love three times a day
And get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day
Aingt no other way
It's in your DNA
Let everybody know who you am
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye
Nice of you to stop over
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye
Before you do roll over
Love three times a day
Lock yourself away
Hate is so passé
And get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day
Is no naiveté
It's in your DNA
And tell em that you came with the band
It's the same ol' same ol'
Put it in the tane
If you really need a lover
Honey call my name
You can lose your mind
Looking for a girl
Like you're looking for a diamond
In a rhinestone world
There's a one kinda lover
That is just my style
That's a downtown lady
With an uptown smile
Top hat clothes kissing lipstick girls
Chasin’ high class lows with a señorita’s pearls
Love three times a day
Lock yourself away
Love three times a day
And get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day
Ain’t no other way
A matinee
It’s time that you be takin’ a stand
You’ll never know another lover
In the whole wide world
Who can love you like a lover
Ya with this kinda love
Now the way in which she loved ya
Like nobody else could
And the way that she been lovin’
Everybody understood
Too heavy heed
When you ain’t got none
You’ll be gettin outta jail
We’re gonna all have fun
Where’s your game face baby
Don’t ya look so sad
I’m the best damn lover
That you ever ever had
Love three times a day
I’m a cashier lover
I’m the cat’s meow
I ain’t never gonna stop
I never know how
You said you done it in a minute
In too few years
You don’t wanna get jealous
Someon else’s tears
Love three times a day
If you get sex on a hot tin roof
You’ll be higher than a child of a million proof
It’s the same ol’ same ol’
Puttin in the thing
If you really need a lover
Honey call my
NAME

# 7 Arctic Monkeys Balaclava 
Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone
Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
And you wish you'd never been born
And you tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble
Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava I'm sure you baffle em straight
And it's wrong wrong wrong she can hardly wait
That's right he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime
That's right he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this
Crime
That's right he wont let her out his sight
That's right he wont let her out his sight
That's right he wont let her out his sight
You'll be able to post any day of the most
For the sights of all time
You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart I'd much rather keep on the balaclava

# 8 Clash coca cola
Elevator Going up
In the gleaming corridor of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision a clinical precision
Jumping from the windows filled with indecision
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
e adds life where there isn't any
So freeze man freeze
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You won't need a launderette you can send them to the vet
I get my advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
e adds life where there isn't any
So freeze man freeze
coca cola advertising and cocaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper they're crazy
Suit your life maybe so
In the White House I know
All Over Berlin they've been doing it for years
And in Manhattan
Coming through the door is a snub nose 44
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leaping from the windows saying
Don't give me none of this
e adds life says the advertising world
Treat me nice the party girl
e adds life where there isn't any
So freeze man freeze
Hit the deck

The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
I got this girl beside me
But she's out of reach
Headlight through my window
Shining on the wall
Headlight through my window
Shining on the wall
Can't hear my baby
Though I called and called
Yeah right
Woo
Windows started trembling
With a sonic boom
Windows started trembling
With a sonic boom boom
A cold girl'll kill you
In a darkened room
Yeah woo

# 11 Billy Joel An Innocent Man
Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by
Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie
I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above
Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before
Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore
I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I've not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand
Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man
You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below
Anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began
Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man

Baby used to stay out every night
But not no more
Now me and baby always used to fight
But not anymore
Baby used to think it was alright
But not no more
Baby used to think I was a bore
She don't think that no more

Someone to understand her
But it's too late cause
Daddy don't live here anymore

Daddy don't live here anymore

Now baby tries to call me all the time
And when she don't get through she wonders
Friends ask if I might have changed my mind
But I just changed the number
They all say you're not that kinda guy
To be hiding from her
Now all of them admit she was a tramp
But won't you give her one more chance
She's never gonna change
Nobody's gonna rearrange her
But it's too late cause
Daddy don't live here anymore
No no no more

# 14 Julian Cope Autogeddon Blues
I had a dream in the middle of the day
And now my waking dream won't go away
I watched the city swallow everywhere
Only shantytowns of despair
And these things I saw;
Roadculture at the end of the line
Citydwelling at the end of the line
Motherfucking at the end of the line
These things I saw and these things are fine
I had a dream in the middle of the day
And my waking dream won't go away
Motorway services were the new cities
The poisonous air had wrecked our homes
Gasoline rivers burning up the seas
And I saw my people down on their knees
I had a dream in the middle of the day
And now my waking dream won't go away
So I left the city just to breathe some air
Just to keep my old brain from busting
Yeah I left the city just to breathe some air
But out here in the fields
You know they're still just fields
Still fences and signs screaming:
Keep off my land
No Trespass   By Order
By drunken disorder more likely old prick
Your drunken development's making me sick
Your drunken development's making me yawn
I shit on your reason
Your rose is my thorn
I had a dream in the middle of the day
And now my waking dream won't go away
So I walk walk walk right over that land
Yes I walk and I keep on walking
I grab a rock from the ground yeah
This is no game
Decide I'll let my rock do the talking
Til' a man drives up in a 4 by 4
Up to me all alone on this lonely moor
And my rock says hello to his gaping jaw
And my rock says bye bye to his bleeding head
Well I never saw a dead man but he looked dead
I had a dream in the middle of the day
And my waking dream won't go away
And they wonder why a man behave like this
Behave like he wants to feel the land is his
But I heard Mama crying in my deepest dreams
Mama told me to do it
This is not what it seems
There are more of us a coming
There are more like me
Messed up   messed up with nothing to lose
It's a barbed wire fence
Which side do you choose
And I can't shake the feeling this has happened before
My nightmare returning
In Autogeddon we're burning
And I can't shake the feeling this has happened before
My nightmare returning
In Autogeddon we're burning

A beautiful mind or a beautiful body
I know which one I'm gonna end upon
You say you will but you never promised thoughts
A simle and a hand mix like water with sand
As far as you're concerned
A road and a sign I know which one catches my eyes
And I thought I heard it for a while
Then it all came to me
Sometimes I just don't know I believe in
Don't you wanna kow when I suffer
It doesn't show
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand don't you know
I was thinking about moving back home
I don't really need to live here no no no no
I didn't I could I'm sure I would if I knew that
I didn't I couldl I'm sure I would if I knew that

Hasn't see the light for days

You had no place to say The skies are all mine
And I'm proud to be here
But when my lover cries I feel his tears
I was gonna drive you home
I was going to tell you who I wanted
We came back to the same place
We didn't speak just danced in our minds
Oh lover I know this aingt what it should be
But let me take you home
I'll show you what you should see
I was gonna drive you home
I was gonna tell you who I wanted
I was gonna drive you home

I know it's there but I just can't see it
I know it's there but I can't see it
A little light with you and me in it
I know it's there but I can't see it
I was thinking about the times I could have had
And whether they turn out good if they turn out bad
I was going to take you home
Show you things your lover wouldn't know
My angel my lover my angel
My mind lover my mind lover
She's my mind lover

Scaling the sky

You got nothing to do
Come outside and play with me

Follow me down to the bushes dear
No one will know
We'll disappear
I'll hold your hand
We'll never tell
Our private little trip to hell
Tonight
Can I walk you home tonight

# 20 Boy Sets Fire Dear George
It's not enough to say you're sorry
It's not enough to say you care
The flowers that you sent were lovely
But they won't take root anywhere
Why I didn't learn the first time
Not to ask you back around
All my friends think that I'm crazy
Not to chase you out of town
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Cause life with you is Georgiaâ€¦
I remember the day that I first met you
I took the lying share of doubt
You held all others high above me
I think you needed filling out
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Life with you is Georgiaâ€¦
Sometimes I know you feel a bit let down
It's not the same without your friends around
And it must be hard to look around my place
Cause you can't find what you're looking for
Cause they're not here anymore
As if you didn't know
Did you learn this from your father
Did your family pass it down
Cause now you got me cursing Islam
My religions' sacred ground
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Waiting for something more than what you gave
Life with you is Georgiaâ€¦
Life with youâ€¦
Yeah life with you is Georgia
HELL YEAH

# 23 Strokes Ize Of The World
I think I know what you mean but watch what you say
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream
Your mind would wonder and search for it's place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born it followed you round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud
Your sad but you smile
It's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change
It's the muscles around your eyes
An egg to fertilize
A pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize
A life to scrutinize
A child to criticize
Young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize
Generations to desensitize
You're dreams are sweet and obsessed
And you're overworked
You've over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would DeadIdealistic Desperate Inventor Pioneer Philosophers be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live as free and detatched as boats to the dock
Just as music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free mind or for falling apart
Night after night
You turn out the light
You don't fall asleep
Right away
are we are we done
A desk to organize
A product to advertise
A market to monopolize
Movie stars you idolize
Leaders to scandalize
Enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize
Fury to tranquilize
Weapons to synchronize
Cities to
Vaporize

# 24 Wilco Don't You Honey Me
Don't you honey me honey bee
A good time I'll set you free
Don't be too nice too nice to me
I've been stung and I've grown mean
Honestly I know what you want
And I can't satisfy you
Honestly it hurts me too
And I don't want to make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue
Don't sit next to me in a tree
K I S S I N G
Who's that bouncing on your knee
Could it be my baby bumble bee
Who's that bouncing on your knee
Give me back my baby bumble bee
Honestly I know what you need
And I just wanna be true
I love you too
And I don't wanna make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue

# 25 Yeah Yeah Yeahs Date With The Night
I got a date with the night burning down my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight we're sweating in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight
Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke
Don tell me to fix her don tell me to fix her
Just take a bite no hanging no picture
Flyin out my sight dropping brides at the altar
Both Thighs squeeze tight
Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke Choke
I'll set you I'll set it off
I'll set you I'll set it off
I'll set you I'll set it off off
I'll set you I'll set it off
I'll set you I'll set it off
I'll set you I'll set it off
I'll set you I'll set it off off off
Buying out the fight gon walk on water
Gon catcha the kids dry gonna bend my finger
Buying out my fight we're sweatin in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight Both Thighs squeeze tight
