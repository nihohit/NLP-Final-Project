# 1 LADY GAGA - POKERFACE 
I wanna hold em like they do in Texas Plays
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me I love it
Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after hes been hooked Ill play the one thats on his heart
Oh oh oh
Ill get him hot show him what Ive got
Oh oh oh
Ill get him hot show him what Ive got
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
poker face poker face
poker face poker face
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when youre with me I love it
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when its love if its not rough it isnt fun fun
Oh oh oh
Ill get him hot show him what Ive got
Oh oh oh
Ill get him hot show him what Ive got
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
poker face poker face
poker face poker face
I wont tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause Im bluffin with my muffin
Im not lying Im just stunnin with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this promise this
Check this hand cause Im marvelous
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face
Cant read my cant read my
No he cant read my poker face

LUV Madonna
I see you coming and youre gonna have to change the game
