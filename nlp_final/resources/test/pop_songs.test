# LADY GAGA - POKERFACE 
I wanna hold em like they do in Texas Plays
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me I love it
Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh oh oh
I'll get him hot show him what I've got
Oh oh oh
I'll get him hot show him what I've got
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me I love it
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun fun
Oh oh oh
I'll get him hot show him what I've got
Oh oh oh
I'll get him hot show him what I've got
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this promise this
Check this hand cause I'm marvelous
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face p-p-poker face

# Madonna - Give me all your luvin
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U You wanna
I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name
L-U-V Madonna
I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game
Y-O-U You wanna
Would you like to try
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine
As long as you don’t lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away
L-U-V Madonna
Y-O-U You wanna
Keep trying don’t give up it’s if you want it bad enough
L-U-V Madonna
It’s right in front of you now tell me what you're thinking of
Y-O-U You wanna
In another place at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine
Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time I can say a sicker rhyme
Cause it's time for change like a nickel or a dime
I'm roman i'm a barbarian i'm conan
You was sleeping on me you were dosin
Now move im goin in
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (now move)
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one shall we proceed
Me it. Licks. I'm so swag shit
Glad no one gave you this
It's super sonic bionic uranium hit
So I breakem off tricks
Let's pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once yeah I don't give a shit
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
L-U-V Madonna
Give me all your love and give me your love
Y-O-U You wanna
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away
