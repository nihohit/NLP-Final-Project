# 1 THE BEATLES - YESTERDAY 
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

# 2 MADONNA - LIKE A VIRGIN 
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel, shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was getting cold
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine
Like a virgin, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hug me
And your heartbeats, and you love me

# 5 THE ROLLING STONES - (I CAN'T GET) NO SATISFACTION 
Hey look
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

About some useless information
Supposed to drive my imagination
I can't get no, no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
I try and I try and I try and I try try try

When I'm ridin' round the world

And I'm tryin' to make some girl

# 7 U2 - WITH OR WITHOUT YOU 
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you
With or without you

# 8 JACKSON 5 - I WANT YOU BACK 
Uh huh, huh huh huh

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you

To take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance

Followin' the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go

She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene
I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One
Who Would Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Said I Am The One Who Would Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene
Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One

Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Who You Love
And Be Careful What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth Hey

She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Said I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice
She Told My Baby We'd Dance 'Til Three
As She Looked At Me
Then Showed A Photo Of A Baby Cries 
His Eyes Would Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby
People Always Told Me Be Careful What You Do
Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
(Don't Break No Hearts)
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Cause I Smelled A Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

Superstition
Superstition
by Jeff Beck
Very superstitious, writing's on the wall.
Very superstitious, ladder's 'bout to fall.
Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass.
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past.
When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer.
Superstition ain't the way.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ooh, very superstitious, wash your face and hands.
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can.
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong.
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song.
When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer.
Superstition ain't the way.
Hey, hey, hey.
Very superstitious, nothing more to say.
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way.
Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass.

# 12 GUNS N' ROSES - SWEET CHILD O' MINE 
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child o' mine
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
But her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by, aye
Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child of mine
Ooh woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
Ooh ooh ooh
Aah ooh ohh ohh yeah
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child o' mine
Ooo woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child of mine
Ooo yea ehh

# 14 THE EAGLES - HOTEL CALIFORNIA 
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
(Any time of year)
You can find it here"
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain, "Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They're living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
(What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like but you can never leave"

# 15 R.E.M. - LOSING MY RELIGION 
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought, I saw you try
Every whisper
Of every wakin' hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this, consider this
Hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought, I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought, I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream, just a dream

# 16 THE SUPREMES - WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO 
Baby, baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me
Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more? Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises
I'll love ya ever more
I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
And I'll let you guide me
You wanna leave me behind
Ooh, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

# 17 BOB DYLAN - LIKE A ROLLING STONE 
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
You've gone to the finest school, all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise with the mystery tramp
But now you realize, he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that he really wasn't where it's at?
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used, go to him now he calls you
You can't refuse, when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Miscellaneous
Nothing Compares 2 U
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner if a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U
It's been so lonely without u here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better have fun no matter what u do
but he's a fool
'Cos nothing compares 2 U
All the flowers that u planted mama
In the back yard
All died when u went away
I knew that living with u baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
'Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U

# 20 JOHN LENNON - IMAGINE 
Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No Hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Livin' for today
Aaa haa
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace
Yoo hoo
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharin' all the world
Yoo hoo
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

# 21 MICHAEL JACKSON - BEAT IT 
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it, just beat it, beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky, strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
