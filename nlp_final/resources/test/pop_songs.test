# 1 THE BEATLES - YESTERDAY 
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly Im not half the man I used to be
Theres a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And Im waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I cant live with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised she got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give and you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I cant live with or without you
With or without you
With or without you
I cant live with or without you

# 12 GUNS N ROSES - SWEET CHILD O MINE 
Shes got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if Id stare too long
Id probably break down and cry
Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child o mine
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
Shes got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
But her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child Id hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by aye
Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child of mine
Ooh woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
Ooh ooh ooh
Aah ooh ohh ohh yeah
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child o mine
Ooo woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child of mine
Ooo yea ehh

# 14 THE EAGLES - HOTEL CALIFORNIA 
On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell
Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say
 Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
Any time of year
You can find it here 
Her mind is Tiffany twisted she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember some dance to forget
So I called up the captain  Please bring me my wine 
He said  We havent had that spirit here since 1969 
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
 Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Theyre living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
What a nice surprise
Bring your alibis 
Mirrors on the ceiling the pink champagne on ice
And she said  We are all just prisoners here of our own device 
And in the masters chambers they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they just cant kill the beast
Last thing I remember I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Relax  said the night man  We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like but you can never leave 

# 15 R E M  - LOSING MY RELIGION 
Oh life is bigger
Its bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no Ive said too much
I set it up
Thats me in the corner
Thats me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I dont know if I can do it
Oh no Ive said too much
I havent said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper
Of every wakin hour
Im choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool fool
Oh no Ive said too much
I set it up
Consider this consider this
Hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around 
Now Ive said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
Thats me in the corner
Thats me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I dont know if I can do it
Oh no Ive said too much
I havent said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try cry why try 
That was just a dream
Just a dream just a dream

Baby baby baby
Baby dont leave me

# 17 BOB DYLAN - LIKE A ROLLING STONE 
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you 
People call say  Beware doll youre bound to fall 
You thought they were all kiddin you
You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Youve gone to the finest school all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobodys ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now youre gonna have to get used to it
You said youd never compromise with the mystery tramp
But now you realize hes not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say  Do you want to make a deal  
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it aint no good
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Aint it hard when you discover that he really wasnt where its at 
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Theyre all drinkin thinkin that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used go to him now he calls you
You cant refuse when you got nothing you got nothing to lose
Youre invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Sinead OConnor
Miscellaneous
Nothing Compares 2 U
Its been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner if a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U
Its been so lonely without u here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But theyd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better have fun no matter what u do
but hes a fool
Cos nothing compares 2 U
All the flowers that u planted mama
In the back yard
All died when u went away
I knew that living with u baby was sometimes hard
But Im willing to give it another try
Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U

# 24 Anastacia Cowboys Kisses
Cowboys and kisses
Cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Baggy blue jeans and a box of magazines
Is all I have of you
Waitin' on the day you walk back in my life
Like a newborn child  you made me smile 
Then stole my heart away
We may be outta touch  but never out of time
Come back to me boy
Come back to me boy
Cowboys and kisses
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Holdin on to you like a pair of old shoes
That you never throw away
Every road still leads me back to you  yeah
Your little white lies and butterflies made me she'd a tear
Still I'm prayin on the day that you'll be mine mine
Why do all these
Cowboys and kisses
Always seem to bring me down down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those Cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Everytime  everytime baby
Cowboys and kisses
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Yeah
Why do I keep on holding you
When all you do is hurt me?
All my friends say I should let you go
So afraid that I might see
I can't keep on living life like this
Up and down in and out
I wonder  is this world just a cowboy and a kiss?
Or should I choose another?
Cowboys and kisses
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
I said I gotta find myself everytime you go away
Everytime
Everytime you go away
Cowboys and kisses
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
I said I said I said I said
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Gotta find myself everytime you go away
Yeah
Cowboys and kisses
Yeah yeah yeah

# 25 Cher Emotional Fire
I can't wait 'till I see you baby
I can't wait 'till the night comes falling down
I gotta see you again
And even if it couldn't be forever
I'd trade a lifetime for this night together
Hold on hold on
My heart is burning with the heat of this
Emotional fire
Every time I see you
I'm on fire  every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire
Baby feel the warm  give me some
Emotional fire
Emotional fire
There's a feeling when I'm here beside you
Couldn't leave you and I wouldn't try to
Baby  I only need you again
There ain't nothing that can break this fever
The love gets stronger  and the passion deeper
Hold on hold on
I can't let go  'cause there's no stopping this
Emotional fire
Every time I see you
I'm on fire  every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire
Baby feel the warm  give me some
Emotional fire
Emotional fire
I can't wait until I see you baby
I can't wait 'till the night comes falling
Hold on hold on
