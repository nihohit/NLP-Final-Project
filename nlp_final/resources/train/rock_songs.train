# 4 Pearl Jam Keep On Rocking In The Free World
There's colors on the street red white and blue
People shufflin their feet people sleepin in their shoes
But there's a warnin sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin wed be better off dead
Don't feel like satan but Im to them
So I try to forget it anyway I can
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand
Under an old street light near a garbage can
Now she's put the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she's done to it
That's one more kid thatll never go to school
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man
We got a kindler gentler machine gun hand
Weve got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn got roads to drive
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world

# 5 Stone Temple Pilots Atlanta
She lives in a bungalow
She kills me with rosegarden thorns
She waits for me
My love is unusual
It's painted with roses and thorns
With her I'm complete
She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
To me
Visions of mexico seduce me
It goes to my head so carefully
Memories of candles and incense
And all of these things remember these
She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
To me
She comforts me when
The candles blow out
The cake has grown mold
But the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone
But the memories are mine
The mexican princess
Is out of my life
She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
To me

# 6 Stone Temple Pilots Creep
Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Living under house
Guess I'm living I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning just a rhyme
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well I'm half the man I used to be half the man I used to be
Feeling uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be half the man I used to be
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray

# 7 Stone Temple Pilots Glide
Torment the tortured teach me things
I'm so alive
Speak to the speechless
You have inside
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride
Keep it coming I'm going all the way
Keep it coming I'm going all the way
Just give me a half a chance
From throwing it all away
Run to the place that hides the pain
You have inside
Cover my chain it hides the strain
Only to glide
You can hunt for the hunter
He's got nowhere to hide
You can seek with the seeker
But hold on for the ride
There's nowhere to turn nowhere to run
You can fly with the fader fly it
Fly it on the run
There is nowhere to turn to nowhere
There is nowhere to run
You can fly with the fader fly it
Fly it on the run
It's too late time is gone
Later on again cause no one's leaving
Look away

# 8 Stone Temple Pilots Kitchenware Candy Bars
Somebody told me I know where to go
Somebody showed me I was last to know
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
What I wanted is what I wanted
What I wanted is what she wanted
Unfriendly feelings down on wounded knee
Unfriendly reasons some blind mother's need
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
Sell me down the river
What I wanted is what I wanted
What I wanted is what she wanted
You read the words and it sells you life
They sell their words but it's all a lie 

# 9 Soundgarden Big Dumb Sex
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway
I've been looking for a reject
And you aingt had nothing like me yet
Don't you think it's time for motion
I can take what you've been pushing
Hey I know what to do
I'm gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck you
Fuck you
Ya I know what to do
I'm gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck you
Fuck you I'm gonna
I'm the beast and you're the master
You're the meat of the matter
I'm no fool for discretion
When it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't' you don't you want to thrill me
Don't be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway

# 10 Soundgarden Halfway There
I woke up with my feet nailed down
And my head moving the speed of sound
Had a dream I was caught in a maze
And I couldn't find my way back out
Some were born to move mountains around
And some to rot away in jail
I get an itch and when I'm scratching
Everything can go to hell
And how far is halfway there I
Didn't see you on the trail I've
Almost become good enough
Should the good life be so hard won
Is that what our dreams have become
Sometimes when you should an arrow
It can fly across the sky so proud
I would go all the way to the sun
If I didn't have to come back down
And how far is halfway there I
Didn't see you on the trail I've
Almost become good enough
Should the good life be so hard won
Is that what our dreams have become
If you've got a car and somewhere to sleep
Someone who loves you and something to eat
I would say you're doing better than most
Well maybe not as well as some
And how far is halfway there I
Didn't see you on the trail I've
Almost become good enough
Should the good life be so hard won
Is that what our dreams have become
Is that what our dreams have become

# 11 Soundgarden Incessant Mace
He's afraid he'll suffer his fathers fate
Two sets of silver records and plates
Two bloody hands and bleeding hearts
Don't feel it's not to late to start
Only the photographs on your wall
Are chained and down your hall
Reminding you of all the days
When you collected hell to pay
Well hell to pay
I said it's not too late
Not it's not too late
Incessant mace
Oh God I can see it you know it's incessant mace
and broken backs
Are what you
Beneath your treasure chest
You wonder why you're under stress

# 12 Soundgarden Like Suicide
Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck lays my broken gift
Just like suicide
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Finish her
She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she dies
Just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she dies
Just like suicide
Hey yeah
Ohh
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Yeah lent to finish her
Finish her
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
Yeah I feel for you
I feel for you
Girl I feel for you 

# 13 Smashing Pumpkins Do You Close Your Eyes
do you close your eyes when you kiss me
do you close your eyes if you miss me
and do you wonder why
i sent for you tonight
do you wonder why
golden bells are ringing in the year
through all the tears you cried for me
i always knew you could
so hide inside your looking glass surprise
the lies become the truth you hide
the lies become the lusty night
do you close your eyes when you kiss me
do you close your eyes if you miss me
and do you wonder why
i sent for you tonight
do you wonder why
do you dream your dreams when you're with me
and do you see the things that i see
and is it true enough
is it true of love
secrets cloud your ears and fill your nights
with compromise and shadows torn
you make your way to him
the moon becomes your silent confidant
the one you want will stand alone
the one you love is never known
do you close your eyes when you kiss me
do you close your eyes if you miss me
and do you wonder why
i sent for you tonight
do you wonder why

# 14 Smashing Pumpkins Bring The Light
Shot down I stood
Withstood my neighborhood
I got it wrong
But I could
Follow love lest I learn
It's light
To bring the light
I fought with all my might
With light
Oh bring the light
Light
Bring the light
I never felt so good and right
But tonight
You'll never need another sound
Oh bring the light
Bring the light to me
Here and gone oh I trust
You'd spit upon my dust
And mix my ash with your blood
A son of God you know you must arrive
In the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Oh bring the light
Light
Bring the light
It's yours not mine
If you just want to survive
Go grab a glimpse of any star
In heaven's high
I never felt so real and loved and alive
No shadows follow me unsung
In the light
Bring the light to me
A flower song clear and bright
Is it wrong in neon white
To insist you are mine
Standing dumb in the light
Bring the light
Oh bring the light
Bring the light
Light
Bring the light
I never felt so real and right and alive
Don't let them steal you from what's yours by right
Light
Bring the light
You know there comes a place and time
You can't deny
With every movement shadows cast and align
Bring the light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light

# 17 Bruce Springsteen Darlington County
Driving in to darlington county
Me and wayne on the fourth of july
Driving in to darlington county
Looking for some work on the county line
We drove down from new york city
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name
Driving in to darlington city
Got a union connection with an uncle of waynes
We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop
We got rock and roll music blasting off the t top singing
Hey little girl standing on the corner
Todays your lucky day for sure all right
Me and my buddy were from new york city
We got two hundred dollars we want to rock all night
Girl you're looking at two big spenders
Why the world don't know what me and wayne might do
Our pas each own one of the world trade centers
For a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you
Come on baby take a seat on my fender
Its a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do
Just me and you we could
Little girl sitting in the window
Aint seen my buddy in seven days
County man tells me the same thing
He don't work and he don't get paid
Little girl you're so young and pretty
Walk with me and you can have your way
And well leave this darlington city
For a ride down that dixie highway
Driving out of darlington county
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the lord
Driving out of darlington county
Seen wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state troopers ford

# 18 Bruce Springsteen Human Touch
You and me we were the pretenders
We let it all slip away
In the end what you don't surrender
Well the world just strips away
Girl aint no kindness in the face of strangers
Aint gonna find no miracles here
Well you can wait on your blesses my darling
I got a deal for you right here
I aint looking for praise or pity
I aint coming round searching for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch
Aint no mercy on the streets of this town
Aint no bread from heavenly skies
Aint nobody drawing wine from this blood
Its just you and me tonight
Tell me in a world without pity
Do you think what Im askins too much
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch
Oh girl that feeling of safety that you prize
Well it comes at a hard hard price
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Without losing the love that remains
Were all riders on this train
So youve been broken and youve been hurt
Show me somebody who aint
Yeah I know I aint nobodys bargain
But hell a little touch up and a little paint
You might need something to hold on to
When all the answers they don't amount to much
Somebody that you could just to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Baby in a world without pity
Do you think what Im askins too much
I just want to feel you in my arms
Share a little of that human touch
Feel a little of that human touch
Give me a little of that human touch

# 19 Bruce Springsteen Jack Of All Trades
I'll mow your lawn clean the leaves out your drain
I'll mend your roof to keep out the rain
I'll take the work that God provides
I'm a Jack of all trades honey we'll be alright
I'll hammer the nails and I'll set the stone
I'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown
I'll pull that engine apart and patch her up til she's running right
I'm a Jack of all trades we'll be alright
A hurricane blows brings a hard rain
When the blue sky breaks feels like the world's gonna change
We'll start caring for each other like Jesus said that we might
I'm a Jack of all trades we'll be alright
The banker man grows fatter the working man grows thin
It's all happened before and it'll happen again
It'll happen again they'll bet your life
I'm a Jack of all trades and darling we'll be alright
Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood
Here we stood the drought now we'll stand the flood
There's a new world coming I can see the light
I'm a Jack of all trades we'll be alright
So you use what you've got and you learn to make do
You take the old you make it new
If I had me a gun I'd find the bastards and shoot em on sight
I'm a Jack of all trades we'll be alright
I'm a Jack of all trades we'll be alright

# 20 Bruce Springsteen Jungleland 
The rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
And the magic rat drove his sleek machine over the jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down flamingo lane
Well the maximum lawman run down flamingo chasing the rat and the barefoot
Girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet holding hands
From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in jungleland
The midnight gangs assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet `neath that giant exxon sign that brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops cherry tops rips this holy night
The streets alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch blades hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted explode into rocknroll bands
That face off against each other out in the street down in jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the dj plays
Lonely hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on just a look and a whisper and they're gone
Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
The rats own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the
Night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the streets on fire in a real death waltz
Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all they just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded not even dead
Tonight in jungleland

# 21 Aerosmith Big Ten Inch Record

Believe it this chick's no sinch
When I wanna get her going
Then I whip out my Big Ten Inch

I gave my love a little pinch
But she said now stop that jivin

When she puts on my big ten inch
Record of the band that plays the blues
Well the band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues
My gal don't go smoking
And liquor just makes her flinch
Seems she don't go for nothing
'cept for my big ten inch
Record of the band that plays the blues
Band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues

# 23 Aerosmith Fallen Angel
Theres a candle burning in the world tonight
For another child who vanished out of sight
And a heart is broken another prayer in vain
Theres a million tears that fill a sea of pain
Sometimes I stare out my window
My thoughts all drift into space
Sometimes I wonder if theres a better place
Tell me
Where do fallen angels go
I just dont know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling
Now the times in frightening
Cant ignore the facts
Theres so many people
Just slippin through the cracks
So many ashes are scattered
So many rivers run dry
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell
and you dont know why
So listen
Where do fallen angels go
I just dont know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling falling falling
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Somewhere out there theres a shining light
And I got to be with you tonight
And with all were nowhere
We still pay the price
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way
In downtown paradise
Where do fallen angels go
I just dont know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling falling falling
Where do fallen angels go
I just dont know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling falling falling
Theres a candle burning

# 24 Aerosmith I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't want to miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't want to miss a thing
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

# 25 Arctic Monkeys Despair In The Departure Lounge
He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up because
It just won't happen
He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land
It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
Ill
Yesterday I saw a girl
Who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all
And don't say owt cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
Ill
Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me

# 26 Arctic Monkeys Do Me A Favour
Well the morning was complete
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak
It's the beginning of the end the car went up the hill
And disappeared around the bend ask anyone they'll tell you that
It's these times that it ends
The start to breaking off to start to fall apart
Oh hold on to your heart
Do me a favour and break my nose
Do me a favour and tell me to go away
Do me a favour and stop asking questions
She walked away well her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried and I watched and I waited
'Till she was inside forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold will force you to be cold
And do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said do me a favour and stop flattering yourself
How to tear apart the ties that bind perhaps ‘fuck off’ might be too kind
Perhaps ‘fuck off’ might be too kind

# 27 Arctic Monkeys I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen as cold as the night
And you're an explosion you're dynamite
Your name isn't real but I don't care for sound a likes
And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang go
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
Don't know what you're looking for
Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984
I wish you'd stop ignoring me because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen as cold as the night
Oh your an explosion Your dynamite
Your name isn't real but I don't care for sound a likes
And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang go
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984
Oh there is no love no Montague's or Capulet's
Just banging tunes in DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness
Well I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984

# 31 Clash Death Or Glory
Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the
World
And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl
Love n' hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around cause they don't understand how
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
'N' every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock n' roll
Grabs the mike to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Fear in the down sex
They say lie low
You say ok
Don't wanna play a show
No other thinking
Was it death or glory now
Playing the blues of kings
Sure looks better now
Death or glory just another story
Death or glory just another story
From every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every dragging handclap over every dragging beat
That's just the beat of time the beat that must go on
If you've been trying for years we already heard your song
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory just another story
Gotta launch long way
Fight a long time
Get to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas
We gonna fight your brother
We gonna fight til you loose
We gonna raise trouble

Reminded me of you
Expectations left to come up to yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You talked to me when you felt like it
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus you mother was a jazz singer
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the

Last time I was sober man I felt bad
Worst hangover that I ever had
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right
'cos if you wanna run cool
If you wanna run cool
If you wanna run cool you got to run
On heavy heavy fuel
My life makes perfect sense
Lust and food and violence
Sex and money are my major kicks
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks
'cos if you wanna run cool
Yes if you wanna run cool you got to run
On heavy heavy fuel
My chick loves a man who's strong
The things she'll do to turn me on
I love the babes don't get me wrong
Hey that's why I wrote this song
I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill
'cos if you wanna run cool
If you wanna run cool
Yes if you wanna run cool you got to run
On heavy heavy fuel

# 35 Dire Straits Once Upon A Time In The West
Some people get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit
Scaring the pedestrians for minute
Crossing up progress driving on the grass
Leaving just enough room to pass
Sunday driver never took a test
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west
Yes it's no use saying that you don't know nothing
It's still gonna get you if you don't do something
Sitting on a fence that's a dangerous course
Ah you could even catch a bullet from the peace keeping force
Even the hero gets a bullet in the chest
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west
Mother Mary your children are slaughtered
Some of you mothers ought to lock up your daughter
Who's protecting the innocenti
Heap big trouble in the land of plenty
Tell me how we're gonna do what's best
You guess once upon a time in the west
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west

# 36 Dire Straits Portobello Belle
Belladonna's on the high street
Her breasts upon the offbeat
And the stalls are just the side shows
Victoriana's old clothes
Yeah she got the skirt so tight now
She wanna travel light now
She wanna tear up all her roots now
She got the turn up on the boots now
She thinks she's tough
She aingt no English rose
But the blind singer
He's seen enough and he knows
He do a song about a long gone Irish girl
But I got one for you my Portobello Belle
She sees a man upon his back there
Escaping from a sack there
And Belladonna lingers
Her gloves they got no fingers
Blind man he's singing the Irish
He gets his money in a tin dish
Just a corner serenader
Once upon a time he could have made her
She thinks she's tough
She aingt no English rose
But the blind singer
He's seen enough and he knows
He do a song about a long gone Irish girl
But I got one for you my Portobello Belle
Yes and these barrow boys are hawking
And a parakeet is squawking
Upon a truck a paper rhino
She get the crying of a wino
And then she get the reggae rumble
Belladonna's in the jungle
But she aingt no garden flower
There aingt no distress in the tower
Belladonna walks
Belladonna taking control
She don't care about your window box
Or your button hole
She sing a song about a long gone Irish girl
But I got one for you my Portobello Belle

Well bless my soul what's wrong with me
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug
I'm in loveI'm all shook up
Uh huh huh oh hey yeah yeah
Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Now who do you think of when you have such luck
I'm in loveI'm all shook up
Uh huh huh oh hey yeah yeah
Well please don't ask what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death
Well she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in loveI'm all shook up
Uh huh huh oh hey yeah yeah
Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in loveI'm all shook up
Uh huh huh oh hey yeah yeah

# 42 Billy Joel Goodnight Saigon
We met as soul mates
On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives
We came in spastic
Like tame less horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight
We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might
We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong
And who was right
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight
We held the day
In the palm of our hands
They ruled the night
And the night seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highland
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of the motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

# 43 Billy Joel Tomorrow Is Today
I've been living for the moment
But I just can't have my way
And I'm afraid to go to sleep
'Cause tomorrow is today
People tell me life is sweeter
But I don't hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today
I don't care to know the hour
'Cause it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
'Cause I saw it yesterday
So I listen for and answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And what's the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today
Still I'm waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you don't need the love I'm giving
So tomorrow is today
Oh my Going to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
If you don't come I'm sure gonna die in it
Too late Too much given
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of living it
I keep hoping that you will pass my way
And some day if your dreams are leaving you
I'll still believe in you
I don't care to know the hour
'Cause it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
'Cause I saw it yesterday
Though I'm living and I'm singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over
'Cause tomorrow is today

Because of our ties
We can't show each other how we feel tonight
So we'll go home
We'll each pour a glass of white
And we'll face the night
Together alone
Together alone
All we can be is
Together alone
Together alone
Together alone
We'll face the night
Together alone
There's a bright star out tonight
And I hope you see it too
From your bedroom window
If you do look upon it and think of me
And I will think of you
And we'll drift off to sleep baby
Together alone
Girl do you believe in destiny
I do believe that we're meant to be together
Oh girl don't you see
That we will never be
Take a good look at me baby
And these chains holding me
Together alone
We'll get through the night
We'll each pour a glass of white
And try to face the night
Together alone

# 46 Donnie Iris You're Only Dreaming
Watching you sleep
You're wrestling with your memory again
I saw the blood rushing to your head
I saw a tiny tear drop streaming down your face
I heard the passion when you called his name
Oh Carry Sue like you do
How ya couldn't now how you choose
I won't be lonely
Oh I couldn't stand the pain
I've got my pride
I'm a man inside
I won't roll up and die
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
Deep down inside
He's in your mind
It gets you when your tired
He's in your heart
He's in your eyes
And he knows
You never ever could say no
In time you learned to love the way
I look at you
But something in my heart
Tells me that's not true No
Oh Carry Sue like you do
How ya couldn't now how you choose
I won't be lonely
Oh I couldn't stand the pain
I've got my pride
I'm a man inside
I won't fold up and die
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
Deep down inside
I'm only dreaming
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
You're only dreaming
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide

# 47 Donnie Iris You're Holding My Heart In Your Hands
You're holding my heart in your hands
And my heart's begun to dance
So I pray your feelings are true
For there is much that I could lose
I must go on soul control
Close my eyes and trust this road
But where it's going I do not understand
You're holding my heart in your hands
I am afraid of it
I am trembling
I never heard it beating
I wish you'd fly with it
I know you're able
Take me on a rocket flight tonight
With my heart in your hands
I'm on fire I'm hot as ash
For you I'll take this chance
You're holding my heart in your hands
I sometimes lay
In the twilight
Aching for your touch
Now I don't mean to
But I need you
And baby I'm missing you so much
You're holding my heart in your hands
And my heart's begun to dance
So I pray your feelings are true
For there is much that I could lose
I must go on soul control
Close my eyes and trust this road
But where it's going I do not understand
You're holding my heart in your hands

# 48 Billy Joel Lullabye
Goodnight my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away
Goodnight my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark
And deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me
Goodnight my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me
Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on
They never die
That's how you
And i
Will be

# 49 Eddie Cochran C'mon Everybody
Ah well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
Well I've been a doing my homework all week long
And now the house is empty and the folks are gone
Ooo C'mon everybody
Ah well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be a shaking from my bare feet slapping on the floor
Well when you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Ooo C'mon everybody
Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come a home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
They'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more running round with the usual crew
Who cares C'mon everybody
C'mon everybody
C'mon everybody

# 50 Eddie Cochran I've Waited So Long
You are my loved one you are my all
Come to my arms and love me forever

You are my loved one you are the reason
I've waited so long
Time never mattered till you left me in vain
My heart was shattered put it together and then
Heaven will love us surely you know
That stardust will twinkle above us
I've waited so long

I don't mean to hold a gun up to your head
I'll be fine once you are gone of that I'm sure
Another time + I'd be smiling in your eyes
For the sake of all our love
And that I know
But the rising of the Moon
Means the ending of the day
Time waits for no one just takes you away
I don't mean to hold a gun up to your head
It's just the anticipation I can't stand
Well I feel sure that the Genius who did this
Didn't even feel a thud as he drove by
Now I know my day must end with me alone dear
And I see more than only dark on my horizon
Treason + Infamy enter my life
Tear out the spark that illumines the Sun
Down comes the Universe   tumbling down
Everything is come un Done
Everything is come un Done
Cut like a knife in the soil with a spade
Merge with the one light possessing the other
Scream Holly Murder he's done us tonight
Come little sister behold ye the Mother
Come little sister behold ye the Mother

# 54 Julian Cope I Gotta Walk
Greedhead policestate
Admit your mistake
Paranoid
Paranoia
Here to go baby
Here to beat Daddy
Here to catch a falling star
Save yourself some money
Run behind a taxi
Walk behind a funeral car
Doomy doomy doomy
Yet I'm feeling gloomy
Still I hate to screw my Ma
I gotta walk   walk walk walk   gotta walk   I'm hip I'll walk

# 55 Mew She Came Home For Christmas
Don't touch her there she's blindfolded
She remembers on the bus
Into my heart Don't remember
Like you left us without notice
Now you've come back Like you left us
Like you owe us Into my heart
It's not me it can't be
It's not you I can't do what I do if it's you This is not happening
Don't touch her there She told me
She remembers how it felt
Into my heart Don't remember
Like you left us without notice
It's not me it can't be
It's not you I can't do what I do if it's you This is not happening
It's not me it can't be
It's not you I can't do what I do if it's you This is not happening
Come home Come home
Child child child
It's not me it can't be
It's not you I can't do what I do if it's you This is not happening
It's not me it can't be
It's not you I can't do what I do if we're through This is not happening
Don't touch her there He watched her
She knew his look From behind
When she came home for christmas

# 56 Mew The Seeting Rain Weeps For You
Saying goodbye now
Looking at friends
A lump comes in my throat
Hearing them all speak of you
It rains
We have no umbrella brought
With which the wind be fought
The seething rain weeps for you
Speaking of better days
There are so many things I want to say
Should I re live my life
I'd run into you much sooner
Time has it would seem
Quickened it's pace
Leaving upon your face
A curly smile meant just for me
Speaking of better days
I try to remember everything
But as the years go by
The dark moments lift
Like rain clouds do
With destruction hands
And low lit snow becoming
Winter body aches
Speaking of better days
I try to remember everything
But as the years go by
The dark moments lift
Like rain clouds do

# 57 Mew The Zookeeper's Boy
Are you my lady are you
Are you my lady are you
If I don't make it back from the city
Then it is only because I am drawn away
For you see evidently there's a dark storm coming
And the chain on my swing is squeaking like a mouse
So are you my lady are you
Are you my lady are you The rain is falling down the cars remain
You're tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find it's head
But if there's a glitch you're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand
In a submersible I can hardly breathe
As it takes me inside so the light sings
Answer me truthfully do the clouds kiss you
With meringue coloured hair I know they cannot
So are you my lady are you The rain is falling down the cars remain
Are you my lady are you The rain is falling down the cars remain
Santa Ana winds bring seasickness
Zookeeper hear me out:
How dare you go Cold in the rain
Tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find it's head
But if there's a glitch you're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand
Are you my lady are you
Are you my lady are you The rain is falling down the cars remain
Are you my lady are you I could not be seen with you working half the time

# 58 Mew Tricks Of The Trade
What they gonna do to me
Just when I thought I'd be
Done with all the memories
She's calling me
Trouble in her family
What they gonna do to me
Just when I thought I'd be
Letting go of every hope clawing me

Take a chance and shimmy
No Why does it have to be

Hey Too dark to see
Take a chance and shimmy
No Why does it have to be
It's always you and me
This is which we couldn't see
This in which we tried so hard finding
How our creased hearts binding
Pushed you again to never see your friends
To rip apart the light of those
Whose love deprives you
And it's this in which we couldn't see
This in which we tried so hard finding
How our creased hearts binding
Pushed you again to never see your friends
To rip apart the light of those
Whose love deprives you

# 59 South Paint The Silence 
How can you say your life is empty
So late in the day
Why would you stay another second
Now your sight got in the way
A combination
Of love and aggression
Another second lived
Don't paint the silence black now save me
Don't leave it a day
You got a right to stand or die so maybe
You take chances all the same
Pain comes in stages
If we don't make it
Nothing changes
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side frustrates me
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side irates me
Don't leave me to pick up on your questions
Not even a day
It's alright to finish up your sentence
You talk all the same
Pain comes in stages if we don't make it
Nothing changes
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side frustrates me
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side irates me
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side frustrates me
Now the violence sleeps inside
Abandon feeling for just a piece of mind
It's the reason why your teething side irates me

# 60 South I Know What You're Like
I know what you're like
The silence takes my time
I see you in black and white
I know what you're like
Everything will come down to time
Will come down to time
Everyone will come down in time
Will come down in time
I know what you're like
The silence takes my time

Everything will come down to time

Everyone will come down in time

# 61 South Fragile Day
An angel lost it's wings
Amongst the bags of things
Disclosed amounts of greed
Creep in daily
And though naive at first
You must be quick to learn
It's not the words that hurt
So save them
Memories meant for me
Take all the time in the world
All the time you deserve
You'll be lost but you'll be free
Now that luck is found
Our feet wont touch the ground
Might not be first in line
Still we stand by
Cut like broken glass
Leaves splinters in our path
Been guided by your thoughts
So hold that
Memories meant for me
Take all the time in the world
All the time you deserve
You'll be lost but you'll be free
Take all the time in the world
All the time you deserve
You'll be lost but you'll be free
I wont guess forever
Given chance is slender
Forgive this fragile day
And fail to capture thoughts
The restless side has gone away
Breath out
Never forget this fragile day
Lift this fragile weight

Walk on soles that are made in China

Felt like the road was way too long yeah
Cause love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that we're feeling again
Love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again again again
Will those feet in modern times
Understand this righteous anger
Recognise this world's addiction
Understand this world's affliction

Live somewhere in between of what
I've meant to be
Pick the bones clean of angelicanteen meat
Carnivaluate the short and tallerate the weak
Stuck 6 feet sheep yr older than you look
Cracked eyes black as soot
Ariel ariella isadore is a door
Isador able to close the sky and holes
In your eyes when you rise when you feel the
Velvet skies you rise
Manifestering stations ailing incarnations
A test of the broadcast emergency at last
Ariel ariella isadore is a door
Isador able to close the sky and holes
In your eyes when you rise when you feel the
Velvet skies you rise
Till you rise I fill you skies
Till you rise I field yr skies

# 69 Radiohead Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry;
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special;
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here;
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul;
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special;
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here ohhhh ohhhh
She's running out again
She's running
She runs runs runs runs
Runs
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special;
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Can't get the stink out
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
Teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging at the 15th floor
You've changed the lock 3 times
I still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest Hell
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you

The Head of State has called for me by name

Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'm a meth lab first rehab

And step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend

Don't forget me I can't hide it
Come again get me excited
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread
Inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you
To the free field overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend

Come again make me excited

Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don't forget me I can't hide it
There's a match now let me light it
I'm the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm
Not alone I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'll be there and tell me when you want to go
Come on then and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend

Gunning for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there so I couldn't really get her

Factually I the very least of it
Piece of work I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore a busy mind can go berserk
Oh feast on this I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip and I opened up the book
I said
Factually I I'm just a piece of it
Factually I the very least of it
Factually I is just a medicine
Make you wanna cry why don't they let us in

Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith

# 75 Red Hot Chili Peppers I Could Have Lied
There must be something
In the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care
You see so what if I bleed
I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real
A mountain never seems to have
The need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling
I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides cause she is scared
But I don't care
I won't be spared
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

# 76 Red Hot Chili Peppers Otherside
How long how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never changed my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtrays full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again
How long how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever had how long
I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever

# 77 Boy Sets Fire Across Five Years
I said I'm crazy one more time
Pick up the phone and wonder why
So many years of hidden drinks
Pushed down too far to ever win
Locked doors and hidden ghosts
Denied myself with every joke
This was not me
This could never be me
Locked doors and hidden ghosts
Denied myself with every joke
This was not me
This could never be me
Remembering so many times
So many lies
So many lies
Ran so fast the years passes blind
So much time lost killing five
Locked doors and hidden ghosts
Denied myself with every joke
This was not me
This could never be me
Locked doors and hidden ghosts
Denied myself with every joke
This is not me
This is not me
This could never be me
This is not me
This is not me
This could never be me
Whatever poison you may drink
Another list
Of no's persist
Antique and out of reach
I lose my life and take it back
Crashed this side of happiness
Hit the floor
Or hit and miss
Without the strength to follow through
Walked right past
This life and you
Just one more guess
Just one more chance
Just one more life
Of circumstance
One more call
Taking a chance
On circumstance
Just one more guess
Just one more chance
Just one more life
Of circumstance
One more call
Taking a chance
On circumstance

# 78 Boy Sets Fire Curtain Call
In town for one night only lust fame and a feeding of the holy
A new king is crowned for your delight yeah all right
Single file it's just that easya mere man to adore and believe me
Soon you'll be screaming crucify with delight
Take it back before I fall
I'm no hero
Behind the curtain there stands a statue designed to sell as many as we want to
The consquences aren't worth your timewe're divine
A fresh idol for a suffering nation a clean lamb for your slaughtering elation
Another victim of our need to be weak
The lights are on the stage is set for failure
In your minds I will burn in effigy forever
Burn forever

# 79 Kasabian Butcher Blues
Coco believe me
I'm a lonesome man
I wanna get stoned and trip some wires
I wanna get myself underground
I said that you must believe me
When I say I'm fightin the dead
Lyin low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head
But I got these voices that just keep singin out
Sayin
I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
Said thatI just can't stop losing control
Trench wander pavement
Tryin to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees
I guess that you never been here by the look upon ya face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race
Singin out
I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
Said that
I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I got these voices

# 80 Kasabian Empire
Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Come on to the back
I said your needles count for something
Guess I'd better sell you now
Guess I'd be around
Singing for your questions
But you've stolen all of my answers
Too much entertainment drove
And that's not all the colour
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most
Stop
I said it's happening again
We're all wasting away
We're all wasting away
Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Stitch your part of counterfeit
I said your far out here
Taking at the roads
Where you're taken for the simple codes
Swimming with the fishes
While the serpent waves his tongue
With a belly full of splinters
Now you see that I'm the one
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most
Stop
I said it's happening again
We're all wasting away
We're all wasting away

# 81 Kasabian Last Trip
I don't sit alone cos I got you
Making tracks through these woods
I'm gonna get my blues
Just holding snacks
Dropping these tabs a hero comes
This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own he's in flight
I say this is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own
It's a gas
Now I don't see no light
I don't taste no spit
Silent flash hear the bang
I'm gonna get my rush this feeling
No going back this feeling
Holding hands this feeling
With you this feeling
The circus comes this feelig
This feeling this feeling
This feeling this feeling this feeling
This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own he's in flight
This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own he's in flight
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling

# 82 Sonic Youth Junkie's Promise
A hundred dollars used to be more than enough
And now a hundred times a day and still it's not enough
People always tell me you get what you deserve
All I know is all and all is all I've heard
I heard you say: you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else
And did you say: I can't escape myself
And then you did and now there's no one else
To blame you know that I know yeah that times are rough
I'd like to help you out but things are rather tough
People always tell me that you've got to lend a helping hand
Nothing in return is all I expect from you my friend
I heard you say: you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else
And did you say: I can't escape myself
And then you did and now there's no one else
I heard you say: you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else
And did you say: I can't escape myself
And then you do and now there's no one else

They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be

Encourage and deranged you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone
In the evening sun

Someday you'll come back and I'll be dreaming
I was sunburned
I don't wanna break your heart in
Break your heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I love the summer miss the summer
Tell me what you'd do nothing me to
Oh actors they're pretending
And singers they wil sometimes lie
Oh kids are always honest
Cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
You're the prettiest smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen

We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame

Oh I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back
I missed the last bus
I'll take the next train
I'll try but you'll see
Its hard to explain
I say the right thing
But act the wrong way
I like it right here
But I cannot stay
I watch the TV
Forget what I'm told
Well they are too young
And I am too old
The joke is on you
This place is a zoo
Your right it's true
Cause if you can't decide
I shake my head to say
Everything is just great
Ohh I just can't remember
I just can't remember
Raised in Carolina

Trying to remind her
When we go back

But I cannot stay
I watch the TV
Forget what I'm told
Well I am too young
And they are too old

# 88 White Stripes Effect And Cause
I guess you have to have a probelm
If you want to vent a contraption
Well you cause a trainwreck
And then you put me in traction
First came an action
And then a reaction
But you can't switch around
For your own satisfaction
Well you burnt my house down
And then got mad at my reaction
Well in every complicated situation
There's a human relation
To make sense of it all
Take a whole lot of concentration
Well you can't blame her baby
For her pregnant ma
And if there's one of these
On her auto applause
It's just that you can't just take the effect and make it the cause
Well you can't take the effect
And make it the cause
I didn't rob a bank
Cos you made up the law
Blame me for robbing peter
Don't you blame paul
Can't take the effect
And make it the cause
I aingt the reason that you gave me
No reason to return your call
You built a house of cards
And got shocked when you saw them fall
Well I aingt saying I'm innocent
In fact the reverse
But if your heading to the grave
Don't blame the hearse
You're like a little girl yelling at her brother
Cos you lost his ball
You keep blaming me for what you did
And that aingt all
The way you clean up the wreck
Is enough to give one pause
You seem to forget just how this song started
I'm reacting to you
Cos you left me broken hearted
It's just that you can't just take the effect and make it the cause
Well you can't take the effect
And make it the cause
I didn't rob a bank
Cos you made up the law
Blame me for robbing peter
Don't you blame paul
Can't take the effect
And make it the cause

# 89 White Stripes It's True That We Love Each Other
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you
Jack give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you Holly
You been using on pain pills
Jack will you call me if you're able
I got your phone number written
In the back of my bible
Jack I think your pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg do you think Jack really loves me
You know I don't care because
Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now
Well I would Meg
I really just don't know how
Just say Jack  do you adore me
Well I would Holly but love really bores me
Well maybe we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly
You know that I'll love you til the end
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you
Holly give me some of your English lovin
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and just love yourself
If I did that Holly there won't be anything
Left for anybody else
Jack it's too bad about the way you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot
So he'd break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out
And tell em what it's really all about
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you

# 90 White Stripes Hotel Yorba
I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
To the beauty I had found
Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
I've been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take till we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gonna worry about locking the door
Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But i'm so tired of acting tough
And i'm gonna do what i please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
Cause if i'm the man that you love the most
You could say i do at least
Well it's 1 2 3 4
Take the elevator
At the hotel yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's 4 5 6 7
Grab your umbrella
Grab hold of me
Cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy

# 91 Wilco Heavy Metal Drumme
I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love
Shiny shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Into warm liquid flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers beautiful and stoned

Dark places what a simple web we weave

# 97 Florence And The Machine Bird Song
Well I didn't tell anyone but a bird flew by
Saw what I'd done
He set up a nest outside
And he sang about what I'd become
He sang so loud he sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear
So I invited him in just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again
But he sang louder and louder inside the house
And now I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make it stop
Picked up the bird and above the din
Said that's the last song you'll ever sing
Held him down broke his neck
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
But in my dreams began to creep
That old familiar tweet tweet tweet
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
The song was coming from my mouth
From my mouth

# 98 Florence And The Machine Donkey Kosh
With a donkey on my shoulder
And a jackal on my back
I'll carry these my children
Keep them safe from attack
The donkey makes it hard to dance the jackal sings too loud
The donkey cries when it's alone and the jackal is too proud
Little donkey is getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose
I would have a lover
A husband and a child
But the donkey is too jealous
And the jackal is too wild
It's too wild
You ask me why I keep them
Why I love them so
Why they get away with murder
As they grow and grow and grow oh
I keep them cos I made them
They come from in my loins
With each mistake I make
Creative and torn apart
And when it's time to feed them
Before they go to bed
I give them my confessions
Baked within their bread
Little donkey is getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose
Little donkey is getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose

# 99 Florence And The Machine Halloween
Well let me tell you a story now
About a judge a thief and a wife and a clown
'Cause on this fine fine day one of them goes down
The judge said to the thief:
Boy it's a fine day for justice
And the thief said to the judge:
Old man it's a fine fine day for love
The wife said to the clown:
My dear you gotta take the judge down
And the clown the clown he just smiled
As the clown stood covered in the judge's blood he cried:
Well I will be a fool no more I will be a fool no more
As he turned and cartwheeled out the door
Now let me tell you something
The thief the thief and the wife well they left that day
Left the left the clown covered in the judges blood alone
The clown frowned as he fell to the ground:
It's a fine fine day for love
It's a fine fine fine fine day for love
A fine fine day for fools
And I will be a fool no more
Because of you

# 100 Meat Loaf Because Of You
I was so hypnotized by the smile in your eyes today
Flying free as a bird caught in every word you say
I wont ever want to see you
This is big time
This is larger than life
See the sparks fly when your standing by my side
Every step every move everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you
Every breathe that you give
You are my sweet oxygen i breathe
You made me fall away fast
So my dreams could get pass the end
I wont ever want to feel
This is big time
This is larger than life
See the sparks fly when your standing by my side
Every step every move everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you
How did I survive before you came into my life
I'd do anything at all
Anything at all
For you
This is big time
This is larger than life
See the sparks fly when your standing by my side
Every step every move everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you
This is big time
This is larger than life
See the sparks fly when your standing by my side
Every step every move everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you
