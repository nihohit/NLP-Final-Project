# 1 PUBLIC ENEMY - FIGHT THE POWER 
Yet our best trained best educated
Best equipped best prepared troops refused to fight
Matter of fact its safe to say
That they would rather switch than fight
Give it give it give it give it give it come on and get down
Give it give it give it give it give it come on and get down
Give it give it give it give it give it come on and get down
Give it give it give it give it give it come on and get down
Come on and get down
1989 the number another summer
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin your heart cause I know you got soul
Brothers an sisters hey
Listen if youre missin yall
Swingin while Im singin givin whatcha gettin
Knowin what I knowin while the black bands sweatin
An the rhythm rhyme rollin
Gotta give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We gotta fight the powers that be
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power weve gotta fight the powers that be
As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes designed to fill your mind
Now that youve realized the prides arrived
We gotta pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart its a start a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothins strange
People people we are the same
No were not the same cause we dont know the game
What we need is awareness we cant get careless
You say What is this 
My beloved lets get down to business
Mental self-defensive fitness
Bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power weve gotta fight the powers that be
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power fight the power
Fight the power weve gotta fight the powers that be
Elvis was a hero to most but he Elvis was a hero to most

# 2 RUN D M C - WALK THIS WAY 
Backstroke lover always hidin neath the covers
Till I talked to your daddy he say
He said you aint seen nothin till youre down on a muffin
Then youre sure to be a-changin your ways
I met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder
Oh the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of lovin with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin up in the air
Singin hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was foolin
Cause she knew what she was doin
And I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this
Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirts climbin way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin at me
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin up in the air
Singin hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was foolin
Cause she knew what she was doin
When she told me how to walk this way she told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Just gimme a kiss

I used to read Word Up magazine 
SaltnPepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
Hangin pictures on my wall 
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr Magic Marley Marl

Smokin weed and bamboo sippin on private stock 
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match 
Remember Rappin Duke duh-ha duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far 
Now Im in the limelight cause I rhyme tight 
Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner the opposite of a winner

To up close and personal with Robin Leach 
And Im far from cheap I smoke skunk with my peeps all day 
Spread love its the Brooklyn way

Girls used to diss me 
Now they write letters cause they miss me 
I never thought it could happen this rappin stuff 
I was too used to packin gats and stuff 
Now honies play me close like butter played toast 
From the Mississippi down to the east coast 
Condos in Queens indo for weeks 
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak 
Livin life without fear 
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girls ears 
Lunches brunches interviews by the pool 
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school 
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood 
And its still all good 
Uh   and if you dont know now you know nigga 
Super Nintendo Sega Genesis

50 inch screen money green leather sofa 
Got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur 
Phone bill about two Gs flat

And my whole crew is loungin 
Celebratin every day no more public housin 
Thinkin back on my one-room shack 
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back 
And she loves to show me off of course 
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source 
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us 
No heat wonder why Christmas missed us 
Birthdays was the worst days 
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay 
Uh damn right I like the life I live 
Cause I went from negative to positive 
And its all   
Its all good 
and if you dont know now you know nigga uh
Uh uh   and if you dont know now you know nigga

So give it up smooth
Aint no tellin when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep yo dancin
with a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Dont make me act the motherfuckin fool

yo weekly monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly

Tell em where you from 
Straight outta Compton another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke yo my rep gets bigger

But the pussy ass niggaz dont show this
But I dont give a fuck Ima make my snaps
If not from the records from jackin the crops
Just like burglary the definition is jackin
And when illegally armed its called packin
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece o pussy I go up in it
So if youre at a show in the front row
Im a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
Youll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me slut youre composed to
a crazy muthafucker from tha street
Attitude legit cause Im tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself 
every time I pull a AK off the shelf 
The security is maximum and thats a law
R-E-N spells Ren but Im raw
See coz Im the motherfuckin villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killin

And once youre on the scope your ass is through
Look you might take it as a trip

Dangerous motherfucker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont give a fuck thats the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see a punk pass I smile
To me its kinda funny the attitude showin a nigga drivin
but dont know where the fuck hes going just rollin
lookin for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless Never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when I unload see Ill get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and Im jettin
But leave a memory no onell be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot  Fuck her 
You think I give a damn about a bitch  I aint a sucker 
This is the autobiography of the E and if you ever fuck with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
word to the motherfucker straight outta Compton
City of Compton City of Compton

and the chicken tastes like wood
so you try to play it off like you think you can
by sayin that youre full
and then your friend says momma hes just being polite
he aint finished uh uh thats bull
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate
and your friend says man theres plenty of food
 so you pile some more on  your plate
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
of the moment that its time to leave
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
into something that looks like cheese
oh so you say thats it i got to leave this place
i dont care what these people think
im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks
so you bust out the door while its still closed
still sick from the food you ate
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate
and then you call your friend two weeks later
to see how he has been
and he says i understand about the food

because i am the man with the clientele
and if ya ask me why i rock so well

i never forgot what i was told
it was the best advice that i ever had
it came from my wise dear old dad
he said sit down punk i wanna talk to you
and dont say a word until im through
now theres a time to laugh a time to cry
a time to live and a time to die
a time to break and a time to chill
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever ya do in your lifetime
ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
so from six to six til this very day
ill always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
i let them know that im versatile
i got style finesse and a little black book
thats filled with rhymes and i know you wanna look

# 8 GRANDMASTER FLASH - THE MESSAGE 
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs you know they just dont care
I cant take the smell I cant take the noise
Got no money to move out I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldnt get far
Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
Dont push me cause Im close to the edge
Im trying not to lose my head uh huh huh hu 
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage pales used to be a fag-hag
Search and test a tango skips the life and then go
To search a prince to see the last of senses
Down at the peepshow watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp she couldnt make it on her own
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under
My brothers doing fast on my mothers T V 
Says she watches to much is just not healthy
All my children in the daytime Dallas at night
Cant even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
Bill collectors they ring my phone
And scare my wife when Im not home
Got a bum education double-digit inflation
Cant take the train to the job theres a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin on my back
Cant stop to turn around broke my sacroiliac
Midrange migraine cancered membrane
Sometimes I think Im going insane I swear I might hijack a plane 
My son said daddy I dont wanna go to school
Cause the teachers a jerk he must think Im a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer I think itd be cheaper
If I just got a job learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause its all about money aint a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They push that girl in front of a train
Took her to a doctor sowed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I cant walk through the park cause its crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw broke my last glass jar
Hear them say you want some more livin on a seesaw
A child was born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but hes frownin too 
Because only god knows what you go through
You grow in the ghetto living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
Youll admire all the number book takers
Thugs pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Smugglers scrambles burglars gamblers
Pickpockets peddlers even pan-handlers
You say Im cool Im no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now youre unemployed all null n void
Walking around like youre pretty boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and youre a Maytag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

She tell me that she needs me cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me she squeeze me lady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy but tease me I dont want it if its that easy
Aiyo bust it baby got a problem saying bye bye

# 12 LL COOL J - I CANT LIVE WITHOUT MY RADIO 
My radio believe me I like it loud
Im the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin down the street to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
Im sorry if you cant understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Dont mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past ten
My story is rough my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold and Im out to crush
My name is Cool J I devastate the show
But I couldnt survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radios bad from the boulevard
Im a Hip-Hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it wont rewind
Cos I play everyday even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really dont care if youre jealous or not
Cos I make the songs you sing along
And your radios def when my records on
So get off the wall become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radios loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride yes the front and back
You would think it was a party not a Cadillac
Cos I drive up to the ave with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud it could rip your clothes
My stereos thumpin like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad cos the girlies scream
And Im still gettin paid while you look at me mean
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Dont touch that dial Ill be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cos the radios thumpin when Im down to play
Im the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cos its a actual fact this jam is Def
Most definitely created by me
Goin down in radio history
Im good to go on your radio
And Im cold gettin paid cos Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But its nuthin ya frontin ya girl I am stuntin
And my radios loud enough to keep you gruntin
My name is Cool J Im from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
Im lookin at the wires behind the cassette
And now Im on the right standing on the eject
Wearin light blue pumas a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
Im on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
Imma make ya dance boogie down and rock
And youll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut creator rock the beat with your hands
Thats right so dont try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and earl chillin on the block
With my box cold kickin with the gangster rock
See people cant stop me neither can the police
Im a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool Js here to devastate once more
Pullin all the girls takin out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me I just say please
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Farmers boulevard yeah

Its the hard knock life for us

Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
From standin on the corners boppin
To drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot with the smoke glock
Fleein the murder scene you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
But since when yall know me to fail Uh huh
Where all my brothers with the rubber grips bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits and what not
Im from the school of the hard knocks we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Lets stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty uh huh
Lets take the dough and stay real jiggy uh huh
And sip the cris and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my homie biggie baby
You know its hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Yall volume 2 sing
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life

I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side
Stayin alive was no jive
At second hands moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth yo rockin the gold tooth Lo goose
Only way I begin to gee off was drug loot
And lets start it like this son rollin with this one
And that one pullin out gats for fun
But it was just the dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin woolies at sixteen
And runnin up in gates and doin hits for high stakes
Makin my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better same damn Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin keys from across seas
Rollin in MPVs every week we made forty Gs

Survival got me buggin but Im alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cuz shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C R E A M 
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Tryin to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short now I face incarceration
Pacin goin up states my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldnt be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is Hell
Livin in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase sellin base
Smokin bones in the staircase
Though I dont know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess thats the time when Im not depressed
But Im still depressed and I ask whats it worth 
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
And stray shots all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shortys runnin wild smokin sess drinkin beer
And aint tryin to hear what Im kickin in his ear
Neglected but now but yo it gots to be accepted
That what  That life is hectic
Cash Rules Everything Around Me

The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I 
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint callin
I left my cell my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways fuck it
Whats been up man hows your daughter 
My girlfriends pregnant too
Im out to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Im a call her 
Im a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didnt want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But Im your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam
I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I 
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Slim you still aint called or wrote
I hope you have the chance I aint mad
I just think its fucked up you dont answer fans
If you didnt want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didnt have to
But you couldve signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man
Hes only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said No
Thats pretty shitty man
Youre like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you you would write back
See Im just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put em on
Cause I dont really got shit else
So that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds 
Its like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous
Cause I talk about you 24/7
But she dont know you like
I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like 
For people like us growing up
Youve gotta call me man
Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan
P S We should be together too
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I 
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Mister Im too good to call or write my fans
Thisll be the last package I ever send your ass
Its been six months and still no word
I dont deserve it 
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on em perfect
So this is my cassette Im sending you
I hope you hear it
Im in the car right now
Im doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive 
You know this song by Phil Collins
From the air in the night
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning 
But didnt then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him
Thats kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now its too late
Im on a thousand downers now Im drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim we could have been together
Think about it you ruined it now
I hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you cant sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you cant breathe without me
See Slim Shut up bitch 
Im trying to talk
Hey Slim thats my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didnt slit her throat I just tied her up
See I aint like you
Cause if she suffocates shell suffer more
And then shell die too
Well gotta go
Im almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot 
How am I supposed to send this shit out 
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I 
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner
But Ive just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now
How far along is she 
Look Im really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And heres an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap
Im sorry I didnt see you at the show
I must have missed you
Dont think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And whats this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too 
I say that shit just clownin dawg
Cmon how fucked up is you 
You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin
To help your ass from bouncin off the walls
When you get down some
And whats this shit about us
Meant to be together 
That type of shitll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that youll be doin just fine
If youd relax a little
Im glad I inspire you
But Stan why are you so mad 
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didnt say who it was to 
Come to think about it
His name was it was you Damn

# 19 ICE-T - COLORS 
I am a nightmare walking psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a death pack the colors I choose
Red or blue cuss or blood
It just dont matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L A will never die just multiply
Colors
You dont know me fool you disown me cool
I dont need your assistance social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream reality is a knife
My colors my honor my colors my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me
What have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked my mothers on crack
My sister cant work cause her arms show tax
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claiming they understanding me
Give me a break what world do you live in
Death is my sect guess my religion
Colors
My pants are sagging braided hair
Suckers stare but I dont care
My game aint knowledge my games fear
Ive no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You aint in my sect you aint my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicides my favorite venue
Colors
So Ill just walk like a giant police defiant
Youll say to stop but Ill say that I cant
My gangs my family its all that I have
Im a star on the walls my autograph
You dont like it so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terrors my show
Psycho-analyze try and diagnose me why 
It wasnt your brother that brutally died
But it was mine so let me define my territory dont cross the line
Dont try to act crazy cause the shit dont faze me
If you ran like a punk it wouldnt amaze me
Cause my colors death though we all want peace
But our war wont end till all wars cease
Colors

# 20 NAUGHTY BY NATURE - OPP 
Harm me with harmony
Dave drop a load on em    
OPP how can I explain it
Ill take you frame by frame it
To have yall jumpin shall we singin it
O is for Other P is for People scratchin temple
The last P   well   thats not that simple
Its sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
Its five little letters that are missin here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game n it seems I gotta start to explainin
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin real mellow
You get home wait a day shes what you wanna know about
Then you call up and its her girlfriend or her cousins house
Its not a front F to the R to the O to the N to the T
Its just her boyfriends at her house Boy thats what is scary 
Its OPP time other peoples what you get it
Theres no room for relationship theres just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what Im gettin at
Who thinks its wrong cos Im splittin and co-hittin at
Well if you do thats OPP and youre not down with it
But if you dont heres your membership
   You down with OPP Yeah you know me 
   Whos down with OPP  Every last homie 
   You down with OPP Yeah you know me
   Whos down with OPP  All the homies 
As for the ladies OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
different
Its the longest loveliest lean-- I call it the leanest
Its another five letter word rhymin with cleanest and meanest
I wont get into that Ill do it   ah   sorta properly
I say the last P   hmmm   stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss blow a kiss back to me now tell me  
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just cos he look just as nice
You looked at him he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldnt be seen with him and honestly you didnt care
Cos in a room behind a door no one but yall are there
When yall are finish yall can leave and only yall would know
And then yall could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do
Now dont be shocked cos if youre down I want your hands up high
Say OPP OPP I like to say with pride
Now when you do it do it well and make sure that it counts
Youre now down with a discount
   You down with OPP    Yeah you know me
   Whos down with OPP  Every last lady 
   You down with OPP    Yeah you know me 
   Whos down with OPP  All the ladies 
This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partners  
that
Had a fall out disagreement yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment bust it
That wasnt the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin feelings
I said Lets go my girl is coming so you gotta leave
She said Oh no I love you Treach I said Now child please
You gots to leave come grab your coat right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing a little thing you shouldnt have put your heart
Cos you know I was OPP hell from the very start
Come on come on now let me tell you what its all about
When you get down you cant go round runnin off at the mouth
Thats rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it wont get back to her or him
Exciting isnt it a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes damn-- skippy Im with it
   You down with OPP   Yeah you know me
   Whos down with OPP This whole party 
   You down with OPP   Yeah you know me
   Whos down with OPP This whole party 
Break it down

Tell your mother tell your father send a telegram
Im like an energizer cause you see I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack thats where youre dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then Push it Along
Youd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MCs
Cause I love it when you wack MCs despise me
They get vexed I roll next cant none contest me
Im just a fly MC whos five foot three and very brave
On job remaining no Im chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see my auras positive I dont promote no junk
See Im far from a bully and I aint a punk
Extremity in rhythm yeah thats what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

So play the resurrector
And give the dead some life
Okay if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed Im agile plus Im worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect Um
Well its kind of simple just remain your own
Or youll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act
But off to better things like a hip hop forum
Pass me the rock and Ill storm with the crew and Proper
What you say Hammer Proper
Rap is not pop if you call it that then stop
NC yall check the rhyme yall
SC yall check it out yall
Virginia check the rhyme yall
Check it out out
In London check the rhyme yall

# 25 ICE CUBE - IT WAS A GOOD DAY 
Break em off
Shit
Yo yo uhh
Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank God
I dont know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dog no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
 Damn 
I got my grub on but didnt pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
 Whassup  
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do
Thinkin will I live another twenty-fo
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and Im askin yall
Which park are yall playin basketball 
Get me on the court and Im trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin niggaz everyway like M J
I cant believe today was a good day
 Shit  
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didnt even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin didnt even look in a niggas direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dogs house they was watchin yo MTV Raps
Whats the haps on the craps 
Shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em
With the seven seven-eleven seven-eleven
Seven even back do Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and Im yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L A
Today was a good day
 Shit  
Left my niggas house paid
 What 
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the 12th grade
Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic
The lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cubes a pimp
 Yeah 
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didnt even have to use my A K
I got to say it was a good day
 Shit  
Hey wait wait a minute Pooh stop this shit
What the fuck Im thinkin about 

# 26 OUTKAST - B O B 
1 2
1 2 3 yeah
Inslumnational underground thunder pounds
When I stomp the ground
Like a million elephants or Silver Back
Orangutans you cant stop the train
Who wants some Dont come unprepared
Ill be there but when I leave there
Better be a household name
The weatherman tellin us it aint gon rain
So now we sittin in a drop top soakin wet
In a silk suit tryin not to sweat
Hittin somersaults without the net
But thisll be the year that we wont forget
1999 Anno Domini
Anythin goes be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences
Are given for living
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig I might just touch Hell
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell look at what came in the mail
A scale an some arm an hammer
Soul gold grill an a baby mamma
Black Cadillac an a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer cure for AIDS
Make a nigga want to stay on tour for days
Get back home thangs are wrong
Well not really it was bad all along
Before your left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello ghetto let your brain breathe
Believe theres always mo oww
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont even bang unless you plan to hit somethin
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont even bang unless you plan to hit somethin
Bombs over Baghdad
Uno dos tres its on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone 
Like that there boy an we still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team crack fiend dyin to geek
Outkast bumpin up an down the street
Slant back Cadillac about five niggaz deep
Seventy-five MCs free stylin to the beat
Cause we get crunk stay drunk at the club
Shouldve bought an ounce but you copped a dub
Shouldve held back but you threw the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four years Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids for them
Shouldve hit it quit it rag top
Before youre up get a laptop
Make a business for yourself boy set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four but we on the road
Hold up slow up stop control
Like Janet Planet Stankonias on ya
Movin like Floyd comin straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pullin off my belt cause a whippings in order
Id like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero taco bell then I hit the border
Piti pat rappers tryin to get the five
Im a microphone fiend tryin to stay alive
When you come to a town boy you better not hide
Cause the dungeon family gon ride ha
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont even bang unless you plan to hit somethin
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont even bang unless you plan to hit somethin
Bombs over Baghdad yeah

# 31 KOOL MOE DEE - HOW YA LIKE ME NOW 
Oh the night train
I throw my tape on and I watch ya
Three second later
I got ya shakin your head dancin instead of sittin
The rhymes kick the beats hittin you
Just like a home run slammin like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin paid usin my rap style
And Im playn the background meanwhile
I aint with that you can forget that
You took my style Im takin it back
Coming back like return of the Jedi
Sucker MCs in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
Im no phony Im the only real macaroni
Playin the mic like its supposed to be played
New jacks you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this
Amateur night at the Apollo 
Get off this stage Im in a rage
Im like a lion thats been trapped in a cage
Im the real king rap is a jungle
I never understood how could one go
To a party watch me stand around and jock me
Become a rapper then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon youre screamin and dreamin
Im from the old school I used to see men
Dies for less but Im not living that way
Ill let my mic do the talkin and let the music play
How ya like me now
Rap is an art and Im a Picasso
But of course why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture and try to get ya
Self in my shoes but they wont fit ya
Im bigger and better forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me again
Respect I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernaculars pure and I can insure
Life or death with my breath my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
Ill make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MCs Ill make your girl say Ow
Shes jockin
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know Ill serve
Run around town sayin he is the best
Is that a test Im not impressed
Get real youre nothin but a toy
Dont ya know Ill serve that boy
Just like a waiter hit em with a place of
These fresh rhymes and make sure that he
Pays the bill and leave him standin still
And when hes had enough hit him with a refill
And for dessert it wont be no ice cream
Im just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream
Make him feel the wrath beat him and laugh
And when I finish them Im gonna ask him
Whos the bests and if he dont say Moe Dee
Ill take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good then Ill make him sweat
All Im talkin about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did how could you beat me
Youre so petrified even scared to meet me
My words the law thats why you dont beef
Youre nothing but a punk track star and a thief
So Im puttin you on punishment
Just like a child never touch another mic
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
I could continue theres more on the menu
But I relax cos Im so far in you
You had enough I know youre overstuffed
If I keep going youll be throwin up
Old rhymes I used to say back in the day
When you used to me to my parties and pay
Nobodys ever gonna rack me this I vow
So all I wanna say is
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now

# 36 COOLIO - GANGSTAS PARADISE 
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realise theres none left
Cause Ive been brassing and laughing so long that
Even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
But I aint never crossed a man that didnt deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know thats unheard of
You better watch how you talking and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta lope   
As they croak I see myself in the pistal smoke    fool
Im the kinda G that little homies want to be like
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the street light
They been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
They been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise
They got the situation they got me facing
I cant live a normal life I was raised by the strip
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
Im a educated fool with my knee on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
Im a loped   out gangsta set trippin banger
And my homies is down so gonna rouse my anger    fool
Death aint nothing but a heart beat away
Im living life do or die what can I say
Im 23 never will I live to see 24
The way things is going I dont know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me 
Power and the money money and the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybodys running but half of them aint looking
Whats going on in the kitchen but I dont know whats cooking
They say Ive got to learn but nobodys here to teach me
If they cant understand it how can they reach me
I guess they cant
I guess they wont
I guess they front
Thats why I know my life is out of luck    fool
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me 
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

# 38 RUN D M C - ITS LIKE THAT 
Its Like That
Unemployment at a record highs 
People coming people going people born to die 
Dont ask me because I dont know why 
But its like that and thats the way it is 
People in the world tryin to make ends meet 
You try to ride car train bus or feet 
I said you got to work hard you want to compete 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
Huh 
Money is the key to end all your woes 
Your ups your downs your highs and your lows 
Wont you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
 Bills rise higher every day 
We receive much lower pay 
Id rather stay young go out and play 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
Huh 
Wars going on across the sea 
Street soldiers killing the elderly 
Whatever happened to unity 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
Disillusion is the word 
Thats used by me when Im not heard 
I just go through life with my glasses blurred 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
Huh 
You can see a lot in this lifespan 
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can 
You noticed one time he was your man 
Its like that what  and thats the way it is 
You should have gone to school you couldve learned a trade 
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid 
Now all the time youre crying that youre underpaid 
Its like that what  and thats the way it is 
Huh 
One thing I know is that life is short 
So listen up homeboy give this a thought 
The next time someones teaching why dont you get taught 
Its like that what  and thats the way it is 
If you really think about it times arent that bad 
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad 
Stop playing start praying you wont be sad 
Its like that what  and thats the way it is 
Huh 
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts 
For a meaning in life is why you search 
Take the bus or the train drive to school or the church 
Its like that and thats the way it is 
Heres another point in life you should not miss 
Do not be a fool whos prejudiced
Because were all written down on the same list 
Its like that what  and thats the way it is 
Huh 
You know its like that and thats the way it is 
Because its like that and thats the way it is
 Repeat these lines til fade 

# 39 TONE-LOC - WILD THING 
Lets do it
Workin all week
9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin
I winked my eye she got into the ride
Went to a club was jumpin
Introduce myself as Loc
She said Youre a liar
I said I got it goin on baby doll
And Im on fire
Took her to the hotel she said
Youre the king
I said Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Shoppin at the mall
Looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said
You have plans for the night
I said Hopefully if things go
Well Ill be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house
One thing led to an other
I keyed the door I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didnt know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said Hey you two I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing
Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please
Posse in effect
Hangin out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl whos just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I aint lyin fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
Still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldnt get her off my jack
She was like static cling
But thats what happens
When body start slappin from doin the wild thing
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing
Doin a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said Chill for now but maybe later youll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said Tone let me tell you one thing
I need Dollar 50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
Youre walkin babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby
Wild thing

# 41 BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS - MY PHILOSOPHY 
So youre a philosopher 
Yes yes yes yes I think very deeply
I think very deeply I think very deeply
I think I think I think very deeply
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
I think very deeply
Lets begin what where why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See Im not insane in fact Im kind of rational
When I be asking you Who is more dramatical 
This one or that one the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and Ill jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and dis you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol something far from a lover
Beside my brother S C O T T
I just laughed cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two my philosophy
Number one was poetry you know its me
This is my philosophy many artists got to learn
Im not flammable I dont burn
So please stop burnin and learn to earn respect
Cause thats just what KR collects
See what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybodys gonna wanna diss you
Like me we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucka MC had a response
You think we care I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
And were real live we walk correctly
A lot of suckas would like to forget me
But they cant cause like a champ
I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic I believe that you should get loose
I havent come to tell you I got juice
I just produce create innovate on a higher level
Ill be back but for now just seckle
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
Ill play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess Ill just start it
Or should I say Start this  I am an artist
Of new concepts at their hardest
Cause yo Im a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It aint about money cause we all make dollars
Thats why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up a lot of games
A lot of suckas with colorful names
Im so-and-so Im this Im that
But they all just wick-wick-wack
Im not white or red or black
Im brown from the Boogie Down
Productions of course our music be thumpin
Others say their bad but theyre buggin
Let me tell you somethin now about hip hop
About D-Nice Melodie and Scott La Rock
Ill get a pen a pencil a marker
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MCs be talkin and talkin
Tryin to show how black people are walkin
But I dont walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug sellin
See Im tellin and teaching real facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they dont care cause the company is sellin it
Its my philosophy on the industry
Dont bother dissin me or even wish that wed
Soften dilute or commercialize all our lyrics
Cause its about time one of yall hear it
And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man
A vegetarian no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
Cause to me thats suicide self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
Youre a philosopher 
Yes I think very deeply
I think very deeply
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
How many MCs must get dissed
Before somebody says Dont fuck with Kris
This is just one style out of many
Like a piggy bank this is one penny
My brothers name is Kenny thats Kenny Parker
My other brother I C U is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker The king or the teacher
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along  nor sing a song
Cause everyoned be singing for the king am I wrong 
So yo whats up its me again
Scott La Rock KRS BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
Were criminal minded an album which is only ten
Funky funky funky funky funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checkin
They take the album take it home and start sweatin
Why well its simple to them its kind of vital
To take KRS-Ones title
To them Im like an idol some type of entity
In everybodys rhyme they wanna mention me 
Or rather mention us me or Scott La Rock
But they can get bust get robbed get dropped
I dont play around nor do I F around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sounds A little unrational
A lot of MCs like to use the word dramatical
Fresh for 88 you suckas

# 42 NAS - ONE LOVE 
What up kid I know shit is rough doin your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
But fuck it black no time for looking back its done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you why dont your lady write you 
Told her she should visit thats when she got hyper
Flippin talk about he acts too rough
He didnt listen he be riffin while Im tellin him stuff
I was like yeah shorty dont care she a snake too
Fuckin with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you
But yo guess who got shot in the dome-piece
Jeromes niece on her way home from Jones beach its bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs all the time
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9s
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega did you see em are yall together 
If so then hold the fort down represent to the fullest
Say whats up to Herb Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what One love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
Dear Born youll be out soon stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin on
The crack-heads stalkin loud-mouths is talkin
Hold check out the story yesterday when I was walkin
The nigga you shot last year
Tried to appear like he hurtin somethin
Word to mother I heard him frontin
And he be pumpin on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together what up son whatever
Since Im on the streets Im a put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with he ask for the phone piece
Whylin on the island but now in Elmira
Better chill cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corners ours
On the reals all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill see you on the next V I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent ya flicks
Your brothers buck whilin and four Maine he wrote me
He might beat his case til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder for real
Ive even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
Sometimes I sit back with a buddha sack
Minds in another world thinkin
How can we exist through the facts 
Written in school text books Bibles etc
Fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed
So I be ghost for my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week
And hittin Ls while Im sleepin
A two day stay you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Belle View
Or H D M hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home nobodys helpin shorty doowop
I roll two phillies together in the prison we call them oowops
He said Nas niggaz cold be bustin off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack my army suit was black
We was chillin on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talkin mad shit
I had to school him told him dont let niggaz fool him
Cos when the pistol blows the one thats murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggaz are struck families fucked up
Couldve caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen so take heed never bust up
In a crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed
Shortys laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose wipin the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that Im a go cyprose
Theres some jewels in the skull that he could sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep a eye out for Jake shorty wop
One love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
   

# 43  YOUNG MC - BUST A MOVE 
Bust it
This heres a jam for all the fellas
Tryin to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But youre standin on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food theyre serving youre stone-cold munchin
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walkin guys start gawkin
Sits down next to you and starts talkin
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move
Just bust a move
Youre on a mission and youre wishin
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
Some frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So dont hang yourself with a celibate rope
Your movies showin so youre goin
Could care less about the five youre blowin
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row
Shes dressed in yellow she says Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
  Just bust a move 
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says No way
Girls are fakin goodness sakin
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic materialistic
Lookin for a man makes them opportunistic
Theyre lyin on a beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach youre strollin real high rollin
Everythin you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin to prove
So dont just stand there bust a move
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
  Just bust a move 
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
  Bring it down for me fellas 
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now hes gonna marry
Hes hopin you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony youll be the best man
You say neat-o check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And theres one more girl you wont be gettin
So you start thinkin then you start blinkin
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that youre winkin
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin really firm cause the girl is stacked
Receptions jumpin bass is pumpin
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do G bust a move
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
  Just bust a move 
If you want it you got it
If you want it baby you got it
  Move it boy 

# 44 DE LA SOUL - ME MYSELF AND I 
Hit it now
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror what is wrong 
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song 
What I do aint make-believe
People say I sit and try
When it comes to being De La
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No were not thats pure Plug bull
Always pushing that weve formed an image
Theres no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Proud Im proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I cant deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Glory glory Hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glorys been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating Im darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q Tip
And he states Black is black
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I dont get in aftermath
But if I do Ill calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree thats me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I
Its just me myself and I

# 45 GETO BOYS - MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME 
Let me drop some shit like this here
Real smooth
At night I cant sleep I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark visions of bodies bein burned
Four walls just starin at a nigga
Im paranoid sleepin with my finger on the trigger
My mother s always stressin I aint livin right
But I aint goin out without a fight
See everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin and blood starts comin out my nose
Its somebody watchin the AK
But I dont know who it is so Im watchin my back
I can see him when Im deep in the covers
When I awake I dont see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say Take a chill B
But fuck that shit there s a nigga tryin to kill me
Im pumpin in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin out my window
Investigatin the joint for traps checkin my telephone for taps
Im starin at the woman on the corner
Its fucked up when your mind is playin tricks on you
I make big money I drive big cars
Everybody know me its like Im a movie star
But late at night somethin aint right
I feel Im bein tailed by the same suckers head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had Caine but it was gold medal flour
Reach under my seat grabbed my popper for the suckers
Aint no use to be lyin I was scareder than a motherfucker
But theyre laughin at pow pies and buried that quick
If its goin down lets get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin trigger
What I sawll make your ass start gigglin
Three black crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
Because Im paranoid
I keep lookin over my shoulder and peepin around corners
My mind is playin tricks on me
Day by day its more impossible to cope
I feel like Im the one thats doin dope
Cant keep a steady hand because Im nervous
Every Sunday mornin Im in service
Playin for forgiveness
And tryin to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is lookin at me
But yet and still its hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then Im worry free but thats bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now shes back with her mother
Now Im realizin that I love her
Now Im feelin lonely
My mind is playin tricks on me
This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trick or treatin
Robbin little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
Wed be in for a squab no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin down we figured
But this was no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now thats the nigga Id been seein in my sleep
So we triple teamed on him
Droppin them motherfuckin Bs on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasnt even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin on the concrete
God damn homie my mind is playin tricks on me

Uh-huh
Comin up I was confused my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out committin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out My Melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggaz had stolen my bike
Different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate Id carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N W A gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And Im raps MVP
Dont make me remind yall what happened in D C 
This nigga aint Gotti he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth 
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top

From the beginnin to the end losers lose winners win
This is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same
How many of them boys is witcha 
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
Im walking with a snub cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin
In the club til they coughin on the rug
Aint never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an Auggie shirt and my coat
Now Im speedin reminiscin holdin my weed in
Never listen if I see him Ima lift em
And maybe thatll even the score
But if not itll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus rockin a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life thank God Im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know Im still nice with my cook game
Look man its a hood thang thats why Im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey Im still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout Im born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put em in my fo-five
And I aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me

# 52 LL COOL J - I NEED LOVE 
When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names
Then the thought occurred tear drops made my eyes burn
Coz I said to myself look what youve done to her
I can feel it inside I cant explain how it feels
All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that Im true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and Ill always be here
Although I often reminisce I cant believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
And half of me deserves to be this way till Im old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
I need love
Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle
Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
Ill give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl youre so sweet
Its deja vu whenever Im with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at youre neither here or there
I swear I cant find you anywhere
Damn sure you aint in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and youll find out what I mean
Fantasys can run but they cant hide
And when I find you Im gon pour all my love inside
I need love
I need love
I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If youre not standing next to me youre on the phone
Cant you hear it in my voice I need love bad
Ive got money but loves something Ive never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man whos ten feet tall
Id watch the sunrise in your eyes
Were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
Youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel
Its like a dream land I cant lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something Ill never forget
I need love
I need love
See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer
A play boy on the run I need something thats stronger
Friendship trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
Its taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand
And understand Ill be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine
If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man
Im not gonna leave it in destinys hands
I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
Ill search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl
I need love
I need love
Girl listen to me
When I be sittin in my room all alone staring at the wall
Fantasies they go through my mind
And Ive come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
Ill be waiting I love you

# 55 TERROR SQUAD FAT JOE & REMY - LEAN BACK CLEAN VERSION 
I dont give a bout your fault or mishappenins
We from the Bronx New York thing happens
Kids clappin love to spark the place
Half the on the Squad got a scar on they face
Its a cold world and this is ice half a mil for the charm this is life
Got the phantom in front of the building Trinity Ave
10 years been legit they still figure me bad
As a youngin was too much to cope with
Why you think B-X nick-named me Cook Coke
Shouldve been called Don robbery extorsion or maybe grand Larceny
I did it all I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long I knew me and my peoples was gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some flow Joe fat with shotty was the logo kid 
Said my dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back lean back lean back lean back
R to the Ezzy M to the whizz-I my arms stay breezy
The Dons stay flizz-I got a date at 8 Im in a 740fizz-Ive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til I die
With a matchin jacket bout to cop me a mansion
My Squad in the club but you know they not dancin
We gangsta and gangstas dont dance we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies
Listen we dont pay admission and bouncers dont check us
And we walk around the metal detectors and there really
Aint a need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor
Reckless check it said it like my necklace started relaxin
Now thats what the hell I call a chain reaction
See money aint a thing  we still the same  flows just changed
Now we bout to change the game
Said my dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back lean back lean back lean back
Now we livin better now Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through any weather now
See haters get tight when you worth some millions
Thats why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelins
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and
If I wouldve brought Compton theyd prolly squeel
Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa real
If you cross the line damn right Im gon hurt you
These even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil Bow Wow throwin it up
B2K crip walkin like thats whats up
Kay keep tellin me to speak about da Rucker
Matter of fact I dont wanna speak about da Rucker
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My champ Pee didnt have to play to win the championship
My dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back lean back lean back lean back
I said my dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away

# 56 BIG DADDY KANE - I GET THE JOB DONE 
Big Daddy Kane
Its A Big Daddy Thing
I Get The Job Done

The question at hand is how do i love thee 
I count the ways but girls dont shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you cant posess me
Because i love a young lady thats beautiful
But one thats smart for me is more suitable
In other words to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be ms kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldnt believe the ones with the chinese cunt
But ill take em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like martin luther king i shall overcome
I get the job done
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down without havin a large pick
Rushin to becomin some pooh-butts wife
And no longer do you enjoy the married life
Well i let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear the big daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldnt
And do certain things he probably just couldnt
Let me sneak into your life like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
Youll say oooh i like it just like debarge how large 
Smooth and mild ill make you smile
Honey child and if you like then get buckwild
And when i turn her back on youll have to say
Like calgon please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband wont im a neighbor who will get the job done  
t r take it to the bridge uhh 
Heres a perfect description of me
Six foot one and dark and lovely
And if theyre sayin black is beautiful its true not phony
Im brown-er than bobby so wont you be my +tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
And uhh the date mack is ready to attack
And prove that im a pro and far from a rookie
Aint no hair on my chest but im one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in 
Id rather be more subtle and smooth and sooth
Girl you wont disapprove
And i promise that youll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm now whats a title to fit me 
A champ like tyson a captain like kirk no
Employee of the month cause yo i do work
The k-a-n-e is on the j-o-b
An expert cause i get it d-o-n-e
So lights camera action - all hail the one 
That gets the job done

# 57 MC LYTE - CHA CHA CHA 
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
You can cha cha cha to this Mardis Gras
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
And I do get better the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt as long as you let her
Do my thing with an 89 swing
The dopeness I write I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac the Uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition youll find them in the hospital
Visiting time I think its on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And Ill blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and Ill lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say come on
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
Ive got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time Ill eat you up with a rhyme
But Ill let you slide cuz you accidentally hopped on the wrong side
Now come on thats suicide hypothetically speaking
Okay lets say you didnt know what you were doing
Youre new in town and youre looking around
For another name to ruin and its me that youre pursuing 
Well well well Ill be damned I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L Y T E
And its shocking Im the one youre mocking
Oh yes Ive been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back its plain to see
That youre a wannabe but you cant be what youre not
So you better start living with what you got
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
Yeah DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now its time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And youre the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That Im a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So dont ever second guess me
And if youre wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And Ill bet that I did it my fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light Itll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night
Kick this tip
Kick this one here for me and my DJ

# 58 DIGABLE PLANETS - REBIRTH OF SLICK COOL LIKE DAT 
We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard rock Brooklyn kids
Us flow a rush when the DJs boomin classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to un thought of dimensions
Whys it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era 
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin Audi
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The Puba of the styles like miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But Im cool like dat Im cool like dat
Im cool like dat Im cool like dat
Im cool like dat Im cool like dat
Im cool like dat Im cool
We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeta cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five plate
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be diggin it with the bump verse
Us we be freakin till dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi
Who understood yeah understood the plan
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or theyll be just like juice
If its the shit well lift it off the plastic
The babesll go spastic hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playin shock it dont matter Im fatter
Ax Butta how I zone man Cleopatra Jones
And Im chill like dat Im chill like dat

They catch a fizz from the Mr Doodle big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn non pigs

# 59 THE ROOTS - WHAT THEY DO 
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Yo yo lost generation fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip hop have been forsaken
Its all contractual and about money making
Pretend to be cats dont seem to know their limitations
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man then stand your own
To MC requires skills I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Giving crowds what they wantin
Offical hip hop consumption the 5th dumpin
Keepin ya party jumpin with an original somethin
Yo I dedicate this to the one dimensional
No imagination excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said Yo we thought we heard you
Jokes on you you heard a bitin ass crew but uh
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill natured its nothing sacred
Hey yo its funny when I see some rap niggaz do to make it
A few would blow up or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya get the party live
Im Black Thought used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
Its various crews that try to touch me
But I come wit the beautiful things and I bless the track plushly
Around the world the crowds love me from doing tours
Recipient of applause from alla you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores you take home
To absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music runnin through these veins
Infinitely go against the grain thats why my mottos to
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Livin the life of limos and lights airplanes and trains
Short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts when the listening start
Open your head wide and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelphi
Ive dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short I want it made like Ed Nuff said
Then after that Im puttin on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the darkskin devil bred and discover
My level is that of no other and roots crew reign offical and true
While Im continuing to
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do
Never do what they do what they do what they do

# 60 HOUSE OF PAIN - JUMP AROUND

And just like the prodigal son Ive returned
Anyone stepping on me youll get burned
Cause I got lyrics and you aint got none
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun
But if you do youre a fool cause I duel to the death
Tryin to step me youll take your last breath

Put out your head then you wake up in the dawn of the dead

# 62 3RD BASS - POP GOES THE WEASEL 
Lets all sing pop goes the weasel
Pop goes the pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started rape rappers against phony entertainers
So we can make it known that we wont get swayed
Its ninety-one son so somethins gotta change
Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop
 Pop pop pop 
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop
 Drop drop drop 
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit 
I guess its the fact that you cant be artistic
Intricate raps becomin so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesnt have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesnt have to be read
So some stay illiterate and feeble legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel
 The weasel 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Hip-hop got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that got a spot in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old thieves that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure
Why score all my points in one period 
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills ya aint originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate now whos diesel 
Not the weasel not the weasel pop goes the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Ya stole somebodys record then ya looped it ya looped it
Ya boosted the record then ya looped it ya looped it
Aiyyo I came from Cali and they hooped it they hooped it
But now youre getting sued kinda stupid
Boosted tracks get slaps ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Cant manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya aint quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who cant cook 
But the minister prime can lay laws
Hey yo Pete Nice rip the mic and go for yours
Goes for mine I goes for mine
Find the prime wont eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the search in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape at Sam Goody
Whyd ya run through the doors some left open 
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and Ima nut like a scud see
Blowin up like Im throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run bout like the measles
No cures cause pop goes the weasels
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
 Pop goes the weasel cuz the weasel goes pop 
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel the weasel

# 63 SLICK RICK - CHILDRENS STORY 
Uncle Ricky could you read us a bedtime story 
Please huh please 
Alright you kids get to bed Ill get the storybook
Yall tucked in Yeah here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
Where people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Where laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin like they ought to good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
Me and you Tike were gonna make some cash
Robbin old folks and makin the dash
They did the job money came with ease
But one couldnt stop its like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D T undercover
The cop grabbed his arm he started actin erratic
He said Keep still boy no need for static
Punched him in his belly and gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled outta gun he said Whyd you hit me 
The barrel was set straight for the cops kidney
The cop got scared the kid he starts to figure
Ill do years if I pull this trigger
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree there he saw the sister
Shot for the head he shot back but he missed her
Looked round good and from expectations
He decided hed head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was running top speed till he was out of breath
Knocked and old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up a door there guess who he saw
Dave the dope fiend shootin dope
Who dont know the meaning of water nor soap 
He said I need bullets hurry up run
The dope fiend rolled back a spankin shot gun
He went outside but there were cops all over
Then he dipped into a car a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doin 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatered and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed the pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Point it at her head he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops Back off or honey heres dead
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded he seemed astounded
And before long the boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only one teen in a madmans dream
The cops shot the kid I still here him scream
This aint funny so dont ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Goodnight
I know this story is really weird
Goodnight

# 64 MASE - FEEL SO GOOD

# 65 COMMON - I USED TO LOVE H E R 
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 Common Sense is gonna drop
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money no studs was mic checking her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggaz had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
Because we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh yo when she was underground
Original pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya I miss her
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 Common Sense is gonna drop
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
By not preaching to me but speaking to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approached
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expanding so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L A 
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the Pro-black was going out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R an B hip house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
1 2 Common Sense is gonna drop
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
But once the man got you well he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs licking rock and dressing hip
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talking about popping glocks serving rocks and hitting switches
Now shes a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But Im committed but so many niggaz hit it
That shes just not the same letting all these groupies do her
I see niggaz slamming her and taking her to the sewer
But Ima take her back hoping that the shit stop
Cause who Im talking bout yall is hip hop

# 67 ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT - TENNESSEE 
Lord Ive really been real stressed
Down and out losin ground
Although I am black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough 
I dont know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandmas past my brothers gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know youre supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire
 Home 
But Lord I ask you
 Home 
To be my guiding force and truth
 Home 
For some strange reason it had to be
 Home 
He guided me to Tennessee
 Home 
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
Lord its obvious we got a relationship
Talkin to each other every night and day
Although youre superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyes burg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young
 Home 
Go back to from where you came
 Home 
My family tree my family name
 home 
For some strange reason it had to be
 Home 
He guided me to Tennessee
 Home 
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
Now I see the importance of history
Why people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst but I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searchin for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

# 70 WHODINI - FREAKS COME OUT AT NIGHT 
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
 The freaks come out 
The freaks come out at night
Discos dont open till after dark
And it aint till twelve till the party really starts
And I always had to be home by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin
Crowds of people lined up inside and out
Just one reason to rock the house
But in the day time the streets was clear
You couldnt find a good freak anywhere cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
 The freaks come out 
The freaks come out at night
Now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
They like to wear leather jackets chains and spikes
They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
Real tight pants and fresh mini skirts
All kinds of colors runnin through their hair
And you could just about find a freak anywhere
But then again you could know someone all their life
But might not know theyre a freak unless you see them at night cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
 The freaks come out 
The freaks come out at night
Now the partys jumpin the place is packed
And when the crowds like this Im ready to rap
But before I could bust a rhyme on the mic
Freaks are all over me like white on rice
Freaks come in all shapes sizes and colors
But what I like about em most is that theyre real good lovers
They do it in the park they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin hearts
You could never tell what a freak was thinkin of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they dont walk when they step they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts
But take my advice you dont stand a chance
Freaks are so bad they got their own dance
So if you wanna live a nice quiet life
Do yourself a favor dont come out at night cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
 The freaks come out 
The freaks come out at night
Hut one hut two
Hut hut hut
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
 The freaks come out 
The freaks come out at night

# 72 BLACK SHEEP - THE CHOICE IS YOURS 
Whos the Black Sheep whats the Black Sheep 
Dont know who I am or when Im coming so you sleep
Wasnt in my room wasnt in my sphere
Knew not who I was but listen here
Dres D R E S yes I get suckers start
If its all right with you Ill rip this here one apart
Back middle to the front dont front
Wanna a good time gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey 
 Hey 
Now get a yo
 Yo 
You gotta hay 
 Huh 
Its for the hoes
 Oh 
The styling is creative Black Sheep of the Native
Cant be violated or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles in parties where they rest
Guess which way what when how
Mista Lawnge Dres Black Sheep slam now
Know youve heard the others phonies to the lovers
Then of course the choice is yours
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at
Wheres the Black Sheep heres the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this why should I swing it like that
Because in fact on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore do as I feel inside
I live with me Ive got my back tonight
Ya know what Im saying yo Black Im not playing
Need to go with this or go with that with no delaying
See in actuality one be can it be
I made it look easy because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play tried to knock it
Never was fool so we finished school
Never see us sweat and youll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while its still here to rock
Dont punch girls and we dont punch a clock
Gotta go gotta go see you later by the cat
And you cant beat that with a bat
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at
Now you can get this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this yes for this is kinda fat
If you get with that then you will surely miss
Because that is so wack I think youll get with this
For in the day in my life or rather the life of my days
Never sweat the chaos for Black Sheep has ways
Although how shall I say it take a point convey it
Styling is quite Dolby yes I know those for you play it
Not to be all that though all that is my goal
Stumble and fell brother like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi give me an egg roll
At A and W get to the Root with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker demo to a single
To the kind with a fly hoe damned the scenario
And pass the paper cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played like a Sony in a Beta
Dres the creator of a style that is much greater
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think youll get with this for this is where its at

# 73 EPMD - YOU GOTS TO CHILL 
You gots to chill
Relax your mind let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Oh you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if youre tired then go take a nap
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now Im bout to shake an bake
The E R I C K is my name I spell
Things to the clientele yo I rock well
Im not an MC who talkin all that junk
About who can beat who soundin like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say check 1-2 and run down a line
To the average MC Im known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker new jack exterminator
Destroyin a ploy when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin your girl why P Cause shes a skeezoid
When Im on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on the top
In the beginnin I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax let my rhymes tax
Maintain MCs while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy you gots to chill
I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says Ill make your toes tap
I format the rhymes step by step
Make em sound deaf to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when its time to roll
Im the P E E M D E E
And one thing I hate is a bitin MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R I P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
Cause M D stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P capital M capital D-E-Es no doubt the chief rocker
Dont like to get ill but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy you gots to chill
Catch every word Im sayin no theres no delayin
Dont hestitate to motivate the crowd Im not playin
Seeing is believing you catch my drift
Dont try to adapt because Im just too swift
How swift Im so swift and thats an actual fact
Im like Zorro I mark a E on your back
I dont swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin sword
Intimidate MCs with the tone of my vocal drone
When Im pushin on the microphone
Cause Im the funky rhyme maker MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when its time issue diggum-smacks
I keep their hands clappin fingers snappin feet tappin
When its time to roll Uzi patrols packin
The Pee MD the mics my only friend
And through the course of the party I kill again and again
So if youre thinkin bout battlin you better come prepared
Come wit your shield and your armoured gear
You gots to chill
DJ La Boss takes no shorts

Lil Kim the Queen Bee so you best take heed
Shall I proceed  Yes indeed

And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me  Not you oh yes whos he 
I even dig yo mans style but I love yo profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But dont blush just keep this on the hush
While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze Im in the PVs
All chrome D3s decked out TVs
CDs with crazy bass keep my lady laced
Dont be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan thats to rise to the top
I told you before when I first pursued
I want a interlude in the nude
You know I love the way you feel-a sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers all in chinchila
Heat up the clutch seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch breakin trees in the dutch
Im not the one you sleep wit to eat quick
Want a cheap trick  Better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off buy this girl gifts of course
So I look slick in my six with my Christian LaCroix

# 75 PETE ROCK & CL SMOOTH - THEY REMINISCE OVER YOU T R O Y  
 I reminisce I reminisce 
 I reminisce I reminisce 
 I reminisce I reminisce 
I reminisce I reminisce
Uh I reminisce I reminisce 
Yeah I reminisce I reminisce 
 I reminisce I reminisce 
 I reminisce I reminisce 
I reminisce for a spell or shall I say think back
22 Years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows huh
18 Years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21 had another one
This ones a girl lets name her Pam
Same father as the first but you dont give a damn
Irresponsible plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he wont down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Mommas gettin married in the house
Listen positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queens risin a chapter
Deja vu tell you what Im gonna do
When they reminisce over you my God
My God
Its so
Yeah so lovely
Thats how we like to do it in the 90s
Pete Rock and CL Smooth comin atcha
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didnt bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but Im clocking pops liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 Kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age front page no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile thats where youre wrong
But give the man a taste and hes gone
Noddin off sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I dont wake him
For this man do cuss hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless hes taking over
I said pop maybe when youre older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good God almighty
Use your condom take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you for real
For real baby
Like that
We for real
Comin atcha
In 92
Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Yeah cmon hit me
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way back so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R-uh-O-Y how did you and I meet 
In front of Big Lous fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine yes in any weather
My grand mom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Docs the greatest better yet the latest
If were talking about a car Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you listen
Listen just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And thats word is bond
Im not playin
Everybody just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
Its like that yall
And you dont stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for 92
And we out later

We got the Refugees All Stars rubba dubbing in the club
Wyclef Jean John Forte Prizewell
Nah mean the streets are getting a little crazy
Looka looka looka looka looka
Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
Should I ask her for a dance
Hold on theres too many in a wolf pack
And besides Dirtycash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to the fever
Quite as his kept that aint even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends
Material Girl living in a material world
But its alright cause its Saturday night
So Mista Funkmaster pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students bring your ouijas
Check the spelling R E F U G E E
Get the CD from Sam Goody he he
You aint even close wit the rhymes that you wrote
Dont be mad cause you broke
Let me clear my throat
John Forte grab the mic roots sway it this way
I more than just a rhymer you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinda
Every step tangod your beat dont concern me
Im eating mangoes in Trinidad wit attorneys
 Oh yeah 
My crews slang flow worldwide like a current
Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance
Brotha do the math you aint half near exotic
My mans claim true you Forget about it
Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence
Well recognize you a lie trying do it
Got juice told your lady oops we nuts baby
Smooth and charismatic automatic you gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth baby and stay alive
Refugee camp nuts baby
John Forte yo watch your lady
Yo watch your lady
Special ill rhyme Dirtycash

In your pocket right now put your hands up
Yo yo you can tell by the way I roll shorty
That Im a ladies man a business man
Condos down the shore multi million pension plans
But it aint in my plan to make move without the fam
I keep it intact you Clef do the track
John play da mack while I pay the tax
Business as Usual watching Suspects
Steal my assets get cut with Gillettes
We built this concept connect like Nynex
Drinks at the bar my American Express
Yo I cook up cook up the cop a pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up you whos calling bluff

# 79 PM DAWN - SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS 
PM Dawn
Miscellaneous
Set Adrift On Memory Bliss
The camera pans the cocktail glass 
behind a blind of plastic plants;
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring 
then you know I cant remember a damn thing 
I think its one of those de ja vu things 
or a dream thats tryin to tell me something 
Or will I ever stop thinkin about it 
I dont know I doubt it 
Subterranean by design 
I wonder what I would find if I met you 
let my eyes caress you 
until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who 
Often wonder what makes her work 
I guess Ill leave that question to the experts 
assuming that there are some out there 
theyre probably alone solitaire 
I can remember when I caught up
with a pastime intimate friend 
She said Bet youre probably gonna say I look lovely 
but you probably dont think nothin of me 
She was right though I cant lie 
Shes just one of those corners in my mind 
and I just put her right back with the rest 
Thats the way it goes I guess 
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Careless whisper from a careless man 
a neutron dance for a neutron fan;
marionette strings are dangerous things 
I thought of all the trouble they bring 
An eye for an eye a spy for a spy 
rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh 
Tell me that shes not dreaming 
Shes got an ace in the hole 
it doesnt have meaning 
Reality used to be a friend of mine 
cause complete control I dont take too kind 
Christina Applegate you gotta put me on 
Guess whos piece of the cake is Jack gone 
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign 
I told her whispers in my heart were fine 
what did she think she could do 
I feel for her I really do 
The next day I had the ring finger on her hand 
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan 
but I had to put her right back with the rest 
Thats the way it goes I guess 
Baby you send me   
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

# 80 CHUBB ROCK - TREAT EM RIGHT 
Nineteen ninety Chubb Rock jumps upon the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesnt symbolize I made it on the top
But Robo Cop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming the media says
What kind of music is this for you to dance to 
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the whack
Or the vile and the nine keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins and youre walking you dont just run
Black on black remember that its important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred the summers almost done
No time for sleep jump in your jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
Youre too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people sing it
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
Can he come out Can he come out and slam a jam 
Im his number one fan yes I am
All these kids realize that Im the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger Doc No Dinky and Hot Dog know
That Im a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all times ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
Thats why when it comes to fans Im never mean
Kids all between Gates and Green
Always says hello cause Im a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star thats mellow
Cause if these kids dont go buy our records
Well be has-beens and plus naked
So we owe them so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house sing it
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Party people in the house listen up
Im the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee good lookin gee
Swinger Hot Dog Doc No Bud Ev Lover Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends give me some lips
Sanity Crystal my niece and Lady Kazan my home girl peace
And leave the guns and have fun out and oh yeah sing it
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Treat me right Ill treat you good
Well coming back the nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps upon the scene
With a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasnt crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib plus kids
Dont need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubs on the map
Cause authority seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic heed my sight and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right please
Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right

# 82 UTFO - ROXANNE ROXANNE 
Yo EMD
Yeah whats up man 
There goes that girl they call Roxanne shes all stuck up
Why you say that 
Cause she wouldnt give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said Hello
Im Kangol from UTFO and she said So 
And I said So I baby dont you know 
I can sing rap and dance in just one show
Cause Im Kangol Mr Sophisticata
As far as Im concerned aint nobody greater
From beginning to end and to beginning
I never lose because Im all about winning
But if I were to lose I wouldnt be upset
Cause Im not a gambler I dont bet
I dont be in no casino and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo
I thought shed be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause Im a sinister trap
I thought itd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess thats what I get for thinking aint that right black 
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang brother I feel bad
But I aint comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause shes an apple a pear a plum and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man if I was grand Id bang Roxanne
Roxanne Roxanne cant you understand 
Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man
You Kango I dont think that youre dense
But you went about the matter with no experience
You should know she doesnt need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me with a high IQ
And shell take to my rap cause my raps the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry I told her it was Gary
She said she didnt like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said shed love to marry my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby shed name the baby Harry
Her mothers name is Baby which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy and you can say its scary
So isnt not every her fathers a fairy
His job is secondary in some military
He throws them to an electric camp that wasnt voluntary
His daughters name is Sherry his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January or was it February 
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
Its only customary to give this commentary
Some say its bad some say its legendary
You can search all you want try your local library
Youll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know after all that all I received was a pat on the back
Thats what you get it happened to me
Aint that right Mixmaster I C E
Roxanne Roxanne
Roxanne Roxanne
You thought you had a rose you thought you was Cupid
But EMD your rap was plain stupid
I know youre educated but when will you learn 
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she cant resist
So educated rapper huh bust this
Since shes a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that Im the debonair Doc
I said Id like to speak to you if I can
And if Im correct your name is Roxanne
She said Howd you know my name  I said Its getting around
Right now baby youre the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner my rap will be brief
She said Ive seen you before you look like a thief
I said Me the Doc a hood a rock 
Running around the street robbing people on the block 
Nah thats not my style that crime Im not related
As far as Im concerned Im too sophisticated
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said You call yourself a doctor   I said This is true
She said Explain to me really what doctors must do
I said This is very rare because I dont say this every day
Theres a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and youll see me and youll know youre again
Theres anesthesiology ophthalmology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body
She said Oh thats very unique
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date
Did you take her to the beach Thats what we planned
But she stood me up Roxanne Roxanne
Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man
Roxanne Roxanne 
And heres our game plan
The beat is here so we will reveal it
And if you think its soft then Roxanne feel it
Mixmaster ice

# 83 BLACK STAR - DEFINITION 
Hello everybody recording live from somewhere
Lord Lord have mercy
All nice an peace an true follow me now we say
Say Hi-Tek yes youre rulin hip hop
Say J Rawls yes youre rulin hip hop
Redefinition say Youre rulin hip hop
Say Black Star come to rock it
Yo from the first to the last of it delivery is passionate
The whole an not the half of it vocals an not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with accurate assassin shit
Me an Kweli close like Bethlehem an Nazareth
After this you be pressin rewind on top your master disk
Shinin like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin
Connectin like a round house from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents heavy regiments
Dont believe here the evidence where Brooklyn see that 
Bound to take it all kid believe that
From where they sellin tree at to where the police be at
Talib Kweli E Kwelity yo tell them where we be at
Brooklyn New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust cause its ghetto fabulous life look pretty
What a pity blunts is still fifty cents its intense
Tree scents is dominant cant be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin MC is short hand for Mis Conception
Let me meditate set it straight came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight let me demonstrate
Walkin the streets is like battlin be careful with your body
You must know Karate or think your soul is Bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin like a bitch already be a visionary
An maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin an talkin about I knew hed amount to nothin
Neighbors like He was the quiet type
Whod have thought they was frontin 
Talkin loud like you in R C A get carted away
With body parts an trays what a way to start your day yo its like
One two three
Mos Def an Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip top
Best alliance in hip hop why oh
I said one two three
Its kinda dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac an Biggie
Too much violence in hip hop why oh
I said Manhattan keep on makin it Brooklyn keep on takin it
So relax were takin it back Redhook where were livin at
Plenty cats be strugglin not hustlin an bubblin
It aint about production an what else we discussin 
When the cock crows my crop grows enable me to rock flows
Strivin for perfection ever since I was a snot nosed
Colossal true original B Boy apostle
Standin on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo
You think you the shit somebody in the wingsll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked Buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry
Without a history of spittin the epitome of stupidity
Livin my life expressin my liberty it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of E Kwelity
People follow me an other cats they hear him flow
An assume Im the real one with lyrics like Im Cyrano
Still sippin wishin well water imported from Pluto
Three hundred an sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers most cats cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheetahs
A Cypher will complete us if we come through your receivers
You can play us an repeat us an then take us home an read us
Line for line good Jesus Mos Def an Kweli
Just make a pussy freeze up thinkin of it ease up
One two three
Mos Def an Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip top
Best alliance in hip hop why oh
I said one two three
Its kinda dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac an Biggie
Hold your head when the beat drop why oh

Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up and to the maximum
I got speakers some ****** tryin ta jack for some
But we packin somethin and what we have for um
Well have a ***** locked up in a maximum security cell
Im grippin oak
Music loud and Im tippin slow
Twins steady twistin like Hit this dough
Police pull up right behind and its in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution

Rollin up a tree green leaves and all
Comin pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five says I got heat
Glock glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop pop hope cops dont see me on the low key
With no regard for the law

Thinkin theyll catch me in the wrong they keep tryin

# 86 DJ JAZZY JEFF AND THE FRESH PRINCE - PARENTS JUST DONT UNDERSTAND 
DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince
Hes The DJ Im The Rapper
Parents Just Dont Understand
You know parents are the same
No matter time nor place
They dont understand that us kids
Are going to make some mistakes
So to you all the kids all across the land
Theres no need to argue
Parents just dont understand
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me my brother my mom oh my pop and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didnt say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said Whats wrong This shirt cost $20
I said Mom this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar 
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips 
I said Mom what are you doing youre ruining my rep
She said Youre only sixteen you dont have a rep yet
I said Mom lets put these clothes back please
She said no you go to school to learn not for a fashion show
I said This isnt Sha Na Na come on Mom Im not Bowzer
Mom please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you dont want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks
She wasnt moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over I tried to play sick
But my mom said No no way uh-uh forget it
There was nothing I could do I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who werent laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said If they were laughing you dont need the 
Cause theyre not good friends
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
Theres no need to argue
Parents just dont understand
Oh-kay heres the situation
My parents went away on a weeks vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind 
Umm well of course not
Ill just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
Ill just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well maybe I shouldnt
Yeah of course I should
Pay attention heres the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
Thats when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You shouldve seen this girls bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said Was that for me 
I said Yeah
She said Why 
I said Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy
She said How do I know youre not sick 
You could be some deranged lunatic
I said Cmon toots - my name is the Prince =
Beside would a lunatic have a Porsche like this 
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I I must say - word
We hit McDonalds pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said Drive fast speed turns me on
She put her hand on my knee I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash I took off so fast
The sun roof was open  the music was high
And this girls hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess thats why I didnt notice that police car
Were doing ninety in my Moms new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said I dont have a license but I drive very well officer
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
Id rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip I said Ah Mom Dad how was your trip 
They didnt speak
I said I want to plead my case
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home I dont know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I cant believe it I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it from me
Parents just dont understand

Knowledge is the key expense is for my background
Label me as a woman and sometimes I feel inferior
Follow me on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand and dis back all the
Men who know no more the slang slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling 
I think its time that we defeat
And stand on our own two feet
If we wanna live wit justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go
In order to let my people know
Times were hard things have changed
Dont try to play me out
Lady
 Dont try to play me out 
Yay yay hey
 Dont try to play me out 
Yay yay yay yay

# 89 WARREN G - REGULATE 
Regulators we regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too but you cant be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean
Earn your keep regulators mount up
It was a clear black night a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Just rollin in my ride chillin all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr Warren G 
Seen a car full of girls aint no need to tweak
All you skirts know whats up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said Lets do this
I jumped out the ride and said Whats up 
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said Im stuck
Since these girls peepin me Ima glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Wontcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
Im gettin jacked Im breakin myself
I cant believe they taking Warrens wealth
They took my rings they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said Damn whats next 
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Aint none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head I think Im going down
I cant believe this happenin in my own town
If I had wings I could fly let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin its a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate
I laid all them busters down I let my gat explode
Now Im switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks and thats a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause its on
N A T E and me the Warren to the G
Just like I thought they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help the Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said Ooo I like your size
She said My cars broke down and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride 
I got a car full of girls and its going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel
Im tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk step to this I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords strings
We brings melody
G-Funk where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm
If you know like I know
You dont wanna step to this
Its the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

# 90 BIZ MARKIE - JUST A FRIEND 
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin to this girl from the U S nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin pourin with sweat
I was walkin through the crowd and gues who I met
I whispered in her ear Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof
I asked her her name she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said How do you like the show  
she said I was very amused
I started throwin bass she started throwin back mid-range
But when I sprung the question she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked Do ya have a man  she tried to pretend
She said No I dont I only have a friend
Come on Im not even goin for it
This is what Im goin sing
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
And you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend
So I took blah-blahs word for it at this time
I thought just havin a friend couldnt be no crime
Cause I have friends and thats a fact 
Like Agnes Agatha Germaine and Jacq
Forget about that lets go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin getttin familiar
Spendin a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some undderstanding
How its gonna be in the future we was plannin
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin was brewin
i called her room a guy picked up and then i called again
I said Yo who was that  Oh hes just a friend
Dont gimme that dont ever gimme that
Jus bust this
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
And you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitors form
He told me where it was and I as on my way
To see my baby doll I was happy to say
I arrrived in front of the dormitory
Yo could you tell me where is door three 
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didnt know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh snap Guess what I saw 
A fella tongue-kissin my girl in the mouth 
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I say
Dont ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

Two minutes and twenty-one seconds of funk
And i aint no punk

Snap your cd and drop the pieces in your casket
Like little jack horna im still bendin cornas
Buckin shots on your block im sippin on coronas
Uh your mcdonald had a farm wit a six-fo on suicide
Sittin in the barn wit no alarm
Straight up collected it cool and calm
Crowbar in my hand and my skeleton brick still works like a charm
Whos the rawest 
My shit is flawless
Had to be passin out bruises 
Lacerations and broken jawses
Emcees wanna floss you better understand whos the boss
Before i do a michael jackson and cut your shit off 
Part of the penitentary still penetratin your grill
I keep on keepin it right while you keep on keepin it real
Ill bring the treble and the bass to delapatate your waist
Coolios on the case get yo hoe out my face fool

And bustas wanna playa hate me

Freestyle in unrestricted manner or method
Free funk text readily selected so check it

And by the time that this little nappy head nigga retire
Ima be at the ripe ol age of forty-eight or forty-niner

My name aint rick james but ill burn your ass with a fire
So whats your desire baby love 
Is it hands wrapped around mics
Or fingers wrapped around triggas 
Eitha way it go im dumpin and im dippin
Still tennis shoe pimpin 40 thevz in position
Fee-fi-fo-fum now nigga im a giant
And yo ass is like jack 
But yo magic beans is wack
Skills is what you lack
Im like a benz you aint even like cadillac
You mo like a regal
Ima pit bull and yous a beagle
Im set to strangle hangin emcees at all angles
As their legs start to dangle 
Dance around everybody like mr bo jangles
Los angeles compton long beach and carson hawthorne
Livin with the watts
Im sendin out shout outs
I used to drink ol gold
Now i just stroll
Straight to the  exit section of my neighborhood liquor store
Huh and you know what make me laugh bitch 
Even your mama want my autograph autograph autograph 
Autograph autograph

Well if youre down say youre down if youre scared say you scared

Or you might lose your life on the mean streets
Middle of the night when the motherfuckin fiends meet
Hold your grip tight yo dont let it slip
You gotta keep your tool for the fools that wanna trip
And if they wanna trip send em on a vacation
All expenses paid for a devils cremation
Cant be no contemplation cos if he busts first youre gettin burst uhh
Layin on your back I guess what Im sayin black is that
If you aint down then dont fuck around
is you down nigga  cos the shit gets thick in my town
This aint a tv show or a song from the radio
Murder on the streets yo is at a high ratio
So it aint no time for playin
You takes the 9 and ima be sprayin
Now what the fucks this look in your eye youre lookin nervous nigga
Earlier tonight you was all ready to service nigga

Real lifestyles where niggas run wild
Day after day the product line is a mile

Niggas be actin wild cos they girl be on my dick
This kid downtown dont like me he say he want me dead

At first I cant sweat it but my little man got hit
We had a lotta thrills but now hes buried in the catskills
Rumour has it that bein with mes a target
My crew go less and less and I resort to wearin a vest
Aint got no type of fans just me and my mans
We be drawin up plans that include the use of guns
Try to stay alive so we can spare no use of funds
A month or two blows a whole year blows
Are we still on our toes as we guzzle all the moet 
Two drunken poets as the first shots hit
My man dont duck quick and gets hit in the chest
I just got nicked cos I had on the vest
Now Im dashin cars in the garage
Run past the path run past the dodge
Rumble for the keys made it to my shit
The ak can spray now niggas is gettin hit is you down nigga 
Are you down for the real 
Are you down for the real motherfuckers  is you down nigga 
Are you down for the real is you down nigga 
Now are you down with the real ass niggas  is you down nigga 
Now tell me if youre down for the real  is you down nigga

# 99 2 Pac Dear Mama
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home I was a fool
With the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddys the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary 
Heeey I see the penitentiary one day
And runnin from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand
For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
Theres no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady   
Dont cha know we love ya Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont cha know we love ya 
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rents due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Pour out some liquor and I reminsce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Sweet lady
And dear mama
Dear mama

# 100 50 Cent Patiently Waiting
Ay Em you know my favorite white boy right

Destination heaven
Sitting political passengers from 9-11 yea 
The Lords blessing left me lyrically incline uh huh

I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at your thang
Straight out the good book

Swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand
Write lines knowin THE SOURCE will quote it
When I die theyll read this
And say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my Pops
Should that make me bitter
I caught cases and got out
Does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world
Im similar to a squirrel
Looking for a slut
Wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone
Will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz aint friends
They know how to pretend
Ive been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on yea 
You can stun if you want
And yo assll get rolled on Its 50 
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long yea 
If you thinking Ima fucking
Fall off your so wrong
 Its 50   
Youve been patiently waiting
To make it through all the hate
Debating whether or not
You can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table
They operating to save you
Its like a Angel came to you
Sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy
But they aint crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playing sick
They aint shit they aint saying shit
Spray umh 50 
A to K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem
You staying wit me
Dont let me lose you
Im not trying to confuse you
When I let lose wit this uzi
And just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message
Am I getting through to you
You know its coming
You motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some BIG and some PAC
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a lil BIG L on top
What the fuck do you got 
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not its like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothing like surviving a shot
Yall know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers theres nothing spookier
Your now about to witness the power of fuckin 50 
Ive been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on yea 
You can stun if you want
And yo assll get rolled on Its 50 
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long yea 
If you thinking Ima fucking
Fall off your so wrong
 Its 50   
Its the Gun Squad here
And you hear the shots go off
 Its 50 They say Its 50 
You see a nigga laid out
Wit his fucking top blown off
 Its 50 Man that wasnt 50 
They dont holla my name
You shouldnt throw stones
If you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw
You should watch your mouth
Cause Ill break your face
Have you ass running
Mumbling to the J
Your going against me dogg
You making a mistake
I split yo lip
You looking like them
Michael Jackson Jackets
Wit all them zippers
Im the boss on this boat
You can call me Skipper
The way I turn the money over
You should call me Flipper
Your Bitch a regular Bitch
Your calling her Wifey
I fucked her feed her fast food
You keepin her Icey
Im down to sell records
But not my soul
Snoop said this in 94
We dont love them hos
I got pennies for my thoughts
Now Im rich
See the 20s spinnin
Looking mean on the 6
Niggas wearing flags
Cause the colors match they clothes
The get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes
Motherfucka
Ive been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on yea 
You can stun if you want
And yo assll get rolled on Its 50 
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long yea 
If you thinking Ima fucking
Fall off your so wrong
