# 1 PUBLIC ENEMY - FIGHT THE POWER 
Yet our best trained, best educated
Best equipped, best prepared troops refused to fight
Matter of fact, it's safe to say
That they would rather switch than fight
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, come on and get down
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, come on and get down
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, come on and get down
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, come on and get down
Come on and get down
1989 the number, another summer
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin' your heart 'cause I know you got soul
Brothers an' sisters, hey
Listen if you're missin' y'all
Swingin' while I'm singin', givin' whatcha gettin'
Knowin' what I knowin', while the black bands sweatin'
An' the rhythm rhyme rollin'
Gotta give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We gotta fight the powers that be
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, we've gotta fight the powers that be
As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the prides arrived
We gotta pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart, it's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize, make a change, nothin's strange
People, people, we are the same
No, we're not the same 'cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say, "What is this?"
My beloved, let's get down to business
Mental self-defensive fitness
Bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, we've gotta fight the powers that be
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, we've gotta fight the powers that be
Elvis was a hero to most but he, Elvis was a hero to most
Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant shit to me
You see straight up racist that sucker was
Simple an' plain, mother fuck him an' John Wayne
'Cause I'm black an' I'm proud
I'm ready an' hyped
Plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamp
Sample a look back you look an' find
Nothin' but rednecks for 400 years, if you check
'Don't worry be happy' was a number one jam
Damn, if I say it you can slap me right here
Get it, let's get this party started right
Right on, c'mon, what we gotta say
Power to the people no delay, make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight the power, fight the power
We've gotta fight the powers that be
What we gotta say, fight the power
What we gotta say, fight the power, come on
What we gotta say, fight the power
What we gotta say, fight the power, come on

# 2 RUN D.M.C. - WALK THIS WAY 
Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers
Till I talked to your daddy, he say
He said "you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' "hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this
Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' "hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way, she told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss
Like this

# 3 NOTORIOUS B.I.G. - JUICY 
Notorious B.I.G.
Ready To Die
Juicy
Intro: 

(Fuck all you hoes) Get a grip motherfucker.

Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me 
I'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that lived above the 
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on 
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughters, 
and all the niggaz in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?

Uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

Verse One: 

It was all a dream 
I used to read Word Up magazine 
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
Hangin' pictures on my wall 
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match 
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far 
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight 
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner 
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner 
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri 
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky 
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would 
Call the crib, same number same hood 
It's all good 

Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Chorus:

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

Verse Two: 

I made the change from a common thief 
To up close and personal with Robin Leach 
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day 
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way 
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me 
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me 
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff 
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff 
Now honies play me close like butter played toast 
From the Mississippi down to the east coast 
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks 
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak 
Livin' life without fear 
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears 
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool 
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school 
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood 
And it's still all good 

Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga 

Verse Three: 

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis 
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this 
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa 
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur 
Phone bill about two G's flat 
No need to worry, my accountant handles that 
And my whole crew is loungin' 
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin' 
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack 
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back 
And she loves to show me off, of course 
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source 
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us 
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us 
Birthdays was the worst days 
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay 
Uh, damn right I like the life I live 
'Cause I went from negative to positive 
And it's all... 

(It's all good)

...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Uh, uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh
Uh, yeah, a-ight

# 4 DR DRE - NUTHIN' BUT A 'G' THANG 
One, two, three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip, shit up

Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuttin' but a G thang, baby, two loc'ed out niggaz  so we're crazy
'Death Row', is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this
(Hell, yeah)

But uhh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective and before me dig out
A bitch I have to find a contraceptive

You never know she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it

And that's realer than real deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh
It's like that, and like this, and like that, and uh
It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well, I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now, it's time for me to make my impression felt
So, sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt

You never been on a ride like this befoe
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some old funky shit

To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh
It's like that, and like this, and like that, and uh
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill, 'til the next episode

Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double O P
D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see

Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit, I think they in the mood
For some motherfuckin' G shit
  (Hell, yeah)

So, Dre
(Whattup, Dogg?)
Gotta give em what they want
(What's that, G?)
We gotta break em off somethin'
(Hell, yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin'
(City of Compton)

It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin' like a muh'fucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucka niggaz mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie they all crumble

Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'

And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop, I told you I'm just like a clock
When I tick and I tock, but I'm never off

Always on to the break of dawn, C O M P T O N
And the city they call Long Beach, puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D O C, no one can do it better

Like this, that, and this, and uh
It's like that, and like this, and like that, and uh
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill, 'til the next episode

# 5 N.W.A. - STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON 
N.W.A.
Straight Outta Compton
Straight Outta Compton
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Verse One: Ice Cube

Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya fuck with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
with a gat that's pointed at yo ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
with a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily
yo weekly, monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
that I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Eazy E] Yo Ren
[MC Ren] Whassup?
[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!

Verse Two: MC Ren

Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
a crazy muthafucker from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself 
every time I pull a AK off the shelf 
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
that's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
but a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...

Verse Three: Eazy-E

...straight outta Compton
is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
and make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin
but don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin
lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot?  Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch?  I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Damn that shit was dope!]

and then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
she came into the bar, she came into the scene
she traveled deeper inside the room

and then your friend says momma he's just being polite
he aint finished uh uh that's bull
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate
and your friend says man there's plenty of food
 so you pile some more on  your plate
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
of the moment that it's time to leave
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
into something that looks like cheese
oh so you say that's it i got to leave this place
i dont care what these people think
im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks
so you bust out the door while its still closed
still sick from the food you ate
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate
and then you call your friend two weeks later
to see how he has been
and he says i understand about the food
baby bubbah but we're still friends

it came from my wise dear old dad
he said sit down punk i wanna talk to you
and dont say a word until im through
now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
a time to live and a time to die
a time to break and a time to chill
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever ya do in your lifetime
ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
so from six to six til this very day
ill always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
i let them know that i'm versatile
i got style finesse and a little black book
that's filled with rhymes and i know you wanna look
but the thing that separates you from me
and that's called originality

# 8 GRANDMASTER FLASH - THE MESSAGE 
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkie's in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
[Chorus:]
Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (uh huh huh hu)
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop, hangin' out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pales, used to be a fag-hag
Search and test a tango, skips the life and then go
To search a prince to see the last of senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
[Chorus:]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under
My brother's doing fast on my mother's T.V.
Says she watches to much, is just not healthy
All my children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
Bill collectors they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
Midrange, migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane!
[Repeat Chorus:]
My son said daddy I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They push that girl in front of a train
Took her to a doctor, sowed the arm on again
Stabbed that man, right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jar
Hear them say you want some more, livin' on a seesaw
[Repeat Chorus:] (x2)
A child was born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but he's frownin too,
Because only god knows what you go through
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps, and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Smugglers, scrambles, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers even pan-handlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n' void
Walking around like you're pretty boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a "Maytag"
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused, and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
[Repeat Chorus:]

# 10 TUPAC - I GET AROUND* 
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the underground
When we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck, all respect to those who break
Their neck to keep their hoes in check
'Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Aiyo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number
Baby when you need me and I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? [Incomprehensible] I get around
The underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the underground, [Incomprehensible], I get around
Yeah, ayo shock, let them hoes know
Now you can tell from my ever day fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get [Incomprehensible]
What's up love, how you doing?
Well I've been hanging, sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin?
Thought I wasn't, see, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around
Tupacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
And round they go
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it, why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real Gs doing time
'Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down? I get around
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, we go

When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love
But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up

In the hood then the ladies saying, "50, you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York they surely will tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look homey, I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Oh you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar, toasting to the good life
Moved out the hood, now trying to pull me back, right?
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you're talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me
'Cause go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
Then watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside their head with a bottle of bub
Come on, they know where we be
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz

So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you don't know
Where we been neither
We in the club all the time
It's about to pop off

# 12 LL COOL J - I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MY RADIO 
My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past ten
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the boulevard
I'm a Hip-Hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
'Cos I play everyday, even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
'Cos I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So, get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
'Cos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad, 'cos the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
'Cos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
'Cos it's a actual fact this jam is Def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid, 'cos Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue pumas, a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
I'mma make ya dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut creator, rock the beat with your hands
That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MC's
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say please
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
Farmers boulevard, yeah
You know that's where me and E hang out, cool out
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's where the crib's at

# 13 SIR MIX-A-LOT - BABY GOT BACK 
Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, ugh, she looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ugh, ya know, who understands those rap guys? Ugh
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute, okay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big, ugh, I can't believe it's just so round
It's like, out there, I mean, ugh, gross!
Look! She's just so, black!
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take yo' picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes m-m-me so horny
Ooh, Rumpo Smoothskin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas!
(Yeah!)
Fellas!
(Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt?
(Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it!
(Shake it!)
Shake it!
(Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!
L.A. face with a Oakland booty
Baby got back!
L.A. face with a Oakland booty
L.A. face with a Oakland booty
I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh!
I ain't talkin' 
~bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-A-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna
(Uh!)
Til' the break of dawn!
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies!
(Yeah!)
Ladies!
(Yeah!)
If you wanna roll my Mercedes
(Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!
Baby got back!
Yeah baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that "hard" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well, I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 
~bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a Triple-X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-ALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back

# 15 JAY-Z - HARD KNOCK LIFE (GHETTO ANTHEM) 
It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Uh huh
Where all my brothers with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty, uh huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh huh
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my homie biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Y'all volume 2, sing
It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

Here we here we go
(Dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Check this shit, yo!
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just the dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cuz shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed, I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is Hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild smokin' sess drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what?  That life is hectic

# 17 EMINEM - STAN 
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam
I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man
He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said "No"
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?
You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the air in the night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him
That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now
I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See Slim, "Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk"
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too
Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin''
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little
I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was you! Damn!

# 19 ICE-T - COLORS 
I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Then dead as a death pack, the colors I choose
Red or blue 'cuss or blood
It just don't matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die, just multiply
Colors
You don't know me, fool, you disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent, but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors my honor my colors my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me
What have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked, my mother's on crack
My sister can't work 'cause her arms show tax
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claiming' they understanding' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion
Colors
My pants are sagging' braided hair
Suckers stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color, your life could end
Homicide's my favorite venue
Colors
So I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gangs my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star on the wall's my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
'Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze try and diagnose me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define my territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy 'cause the shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
'Cause my colors death, though we all want peace
But our war won't end till all wars cease
Colors

# 20 NAUGHTY BY NATURE - OPP 
Naughty By Nature
Miscellaneous
Opp
O.P.P.
------
by Naughty By Nature

Harm me with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em    


OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P...well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

Chorus:
   You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
   You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it...ah...sorta properly
I say the last P...hmmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me  
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

Chorus:
   You down with OPP    (Yeah you know me)  3X
   Who's down with OPP  (Every last lady)
   You down with OPP    (Yeah you know me)  3X
   Who's down with OPP  (All the ladies)

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's  
that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, "Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave"
She said, "Oh no, I love you Treach" I said, "Now child please"
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it

Chorus:
   You down with OPP   (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP (This whole party)
   You down with OPP   (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP (This whole party)

Break it down!

# 21 DIGITAL UNDERGROUND - THE HUMPTY DANCE 
All right, stop whatcha doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny, but yo I'm makin' money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty
Yo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky,  I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak  I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'"
That's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on do whutcha like, and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah! Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do check it out
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin', jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Let's get stoopid!
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Oh, yeah, come on and break it down
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
Keep on doin' the Humpty Dance, and to the ladies
Peace and humptiness forever

Hold it now, hit it!
Yo Leroy!
Aw yeah, yo yo, yeah
Why don't you do that def jam right about now?
Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sippin' pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill, I'm chilly chill
And now I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time? It's time to buy ale!
Peter eater parkin' meter all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine
Miller drinkin', chicken eatin', dress so fly

Get down with Mike D and it ain't no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle
Hold it now, hit it!
Yo Leroy!

It's my rhyme
The now and T, Adam Yauch in the place to be
And all the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D
I'm down with Mike D, and he ain't no baloney
For real, not phony O.E. and Rice-a-Roni
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day
Well I'm the King Ad Rock, and he's MCA
Well I'm a-cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losin'
I'm in my car, I'm goin' far and dust is what I'm usin'
Around the way is where I'm from
And I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum
Because you're pud-slappin', ball-flappin', got that juice
My name's Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis
Hold it now, hit it!
Yo Leroy!
Yo man, that was real def man
Try that again, man I like that def stuff, boy!
Hip hoppin', body rockin', doin' the do
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue
Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps
My name's Mike D and I write my own snaps
Now I'm a peep-show seekin' on the forty-deuce
I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose
Pistol packin', monkey drinkin', no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap skate, perpetratin', money hungry jerk
Every day I drink O.E. and I don't go to work
You drippy nose knucklehead, you're we behind the ears
You like men and we like beers!
Hold it now, hit it
Yo Leroy!
Pass that joint on over
Yo man, pass that over here man, all right
King of the Ave with the def female
You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale
Coolin' at the crib watchin' my TV
Ed Norton, Ted Knight and Mr. Ed
Pump it up homeboy, just don't stop
Chef Boyardee coolin' on the pot
I take no slack 'cause I got the knack
And I'm never dustin' out 'cause I torch that crack
The King Ad Rock, that is my name
Y'all's drinkin' Moet and we got the champagne
A quarter droppin', goin' shoppin' buyin' wigs
Surgeon General cut professor, D.J. Thigs!
Hold it now, hit it!
Hit it!
Hold it now, hit it!
Yo Leroy!

# 23 A TRIBE CALLED QUEST - CHECK THE RHIME 
Check the rhime

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter

Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um, um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message
So you gots to run the pigeon

You on point Phife?
All the time, Tip
You on point Phife?
All the time, Tip

You on point Phife?
All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone
And let your words rip

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong

Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then 'Push it Along'
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know, that you know who I am

A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me

I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect, have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the jim must be erect

You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all

Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out

Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all
Play tapes y'all

Check the rhime y'all
Check the rhime y'all
Check it out, check it out

Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer
And me, The Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack

Yo, Tip you recall when we used to rock
Those fly routines on your cousin's block
Um, let me see, damn I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender

You on point Tip?
All the time Phife
You on point Tip?
Yeah, all the time Phife

You on point Tip?
Yo, all the time Phife
So play the resurrector
And give the dead some life

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child

My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone

Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act

But off to better things like a hip hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and Proper
What you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

NC, y'all check the rhime y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhime y'all
Check it out, out
In London, check the rhime, y'all

# 25 ICE CUBE - IT WAS A GOOD DAY 
Break 'em off
Shit
Yo, yo, uhh

Just wakin' up in the mornin' gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
(Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
(Whassup?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top

And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J
I can't believe, today was a good day
(Shit!)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day
(Shit!)

Left my nigga's house paid
(What)
Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion

I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp"
(Yeah)
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I got to say it was a good day
(Shit!)

Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinkin' about?

# 26 OUTKAST - B.O.B. 
1,2
1,2,3, yeah
Inslumnational underground, thunder pounds
When I stomp the ground
Like a million elephants or Silver Back
Orangutans, you can't stop the train
Who wants some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there but when I leave there
Better be a household name
The weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop top soakin' wet
In a silk suit tryin' not to sweat
Hittin' somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1999 Anno Domini
Anythin' goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences
Are given for living
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch Hell
Get a life now, they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale an' some arm an' hammer
Soul gold grill, an' a baby, mamma
Black Cadillac an' a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga want to stay on tour for days
Get back home, thangs are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before your left, adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always mo', oww
Don't pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit somethin'
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit somethin'
Bombs over Baghdad
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy an' we still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend, dyin' to geek
Outkast bumpin' up an' down the street
Slant back Cadillac, about five niggaz deep
Seventy-five MC's free stylin' to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should've held back, but you threw the punch
Supposed to meet your girl, but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four years, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you're up get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four but we on the road
Hold up, slow up, stop, control
Like Janet, Planet Stankonia's on ya
Movin' like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whippings in order
I'd like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero taco bell, then I hit the border
Piti pat rappers tryin' to get the five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to a town, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the dungeon family gon' ride, ha
Don't pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit somethin'
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit somethin'
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah
Bob your head, rag top
Bob your head, rag top
Bob your head, rag top
Power music, electric revival
Power music, electric revival
Power music, electric revival

This def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?
And together, we can get paid in full
Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cuz ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cuz I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search for a nine to five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cuz, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
'Cuz I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cuz I'm paid in full
Rakim, check this out, yo
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad
'Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you're saying
So let's just pump the music up
And count our money
Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn down the bass down
And let the beat just keep on rockin'
And we outta here
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace

# 28 MC HAMMER - U CAN'T TOUCH THIS 
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
I told you, homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)
Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)
Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show
That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this
Break it down
Stop, Hammer time
Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump
Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't
(You can't touch this)b
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down
Stop, Hammer time
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down
Stop, Hammer time
Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, you can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Get way outta here, you can't touch this

Fugees
The Score
Killing Me Softly
Strumming dub plates with our fingers,
Eliminate sounds with our song,
Killing a sound boy with this sound,
Killing a sound boy with this sound,
Taking sound boys' lives with this dub, 
Killing him softly with this sound.
Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song, 
killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song.

[LAURYN]
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style,
And so I came to see him and listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, stranger to my eyes,
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song, 
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song. 
I felt all flushed with fever,
Embarrassed by the crowd, 
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish, 
But he just kept right on strumming my pain with his fingers, 
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song, 
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song

[CLEF]
Yo L-Boogie, take it to the bridge

[LAURYN]
(Bust it)
Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song, 
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song. 
Strumming my pain with his finger, yeah he was . . .

And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (whoo!)
Mienda, with cash flowin like Sosa
And the latin chick tranportin in the chocha
Stampedin over, pop Mo's, never sober 
Lex and Range Rovers dealin weight by Minnesota (uhh)
Avoidin NARC's wit camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the buildin wit this chick named Alona (uh-huh)
from Daytona, when I was young I wants to bone her (uh-huh)
But now I only hit chicks that win beauty pageants (ahahaha)
Trickin, they takin me skiing, at the Aspens (c'mon)
Uhh, gangsta mental, stay poppin Cristal
Pack a black pist-al in the Ac' Coupe that's dark brown (whoo!)
Pinky-ringin, gondolas wit the man singin
Italian music down the river wit your chick clingin
to my bizzalls, player you mad false
Actin hard when you as pussy as RuPaul

[Interlude:] Puff Daddy

C'mon, c'mon, uh-huh

It's all about the Benjamins baby
Uh-huh, yeah
[repeat 4X]

It's all about the Benjamins baby
Now, what y'all wanna do?
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Wanna be ballers, shot-callers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
Brawlers -- who be dippin in the Benz wit the spoilers
It's all about the Benjamins baby
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus

[Verse Four: Lil' Kim (overlaps last two lines of interlude)]

Uhh, uhh, what the blood clot?
Wanna bumble wit the Bee hahh?
BZZZZT, throw a hex on a whole family (yeah, yeah yeah)
Dressed in all black like the Oman (say what?)
Have your friends singin 'This is for my homey' (that's right)
And you know me, from makin niggaz so sick
Floss in my 6 with the Lex on the wrist
If it's Murder, you know She Wrote it (uh-huh)
German Luger for your ass bitch, deep throated
Know you wanna fill the room cause it's platinum coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, playa hatin from the sideline
Get your own shit, why you ridin mine? (uh-huh)
I'm, a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380's and Mercedes, Puffy hold me down baby!
Only female in my crew, and I kick shit

[Big:] (Yeah, yeah, uhh, uhh, uhh!)

[Verse Five: Notorious B.I.G.]

Hide bills in Brazil, about a mil to ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be, kickin me
in my asshole, uhhh, undercover, Donni Brascoe
Lent my East coast girl, the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)
My West coast shorty, push the chrome 740
Rockin Redman and Naughty, all in my kitty-kat
Half a brick of yea, in the bra, where her titties at
And I'm livin that, whole life, we push weight (uh-huh)
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State (c'mon)
Listen close it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the Mac, my left hand spit, right hand
grip on the whip, for the smooth getaway
Playa haters get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only, to Hell I send thee, all about the Benji's
What??

[Outro: Puff Daddy]

It's all about the Benjamins baby
Uh-huh, yeah

# 31 KOOL MOE DEE - HOW YA LIKE ME NOW 
Oh, the night train
I throw my tape on and I watch ya
Three second later
I got ya shakin' your head dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick, the beats hittin' you
Just like a home run slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid usin' my rap style
And I'm playn' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that you can forget that
You took my style I'm takin' it back
Coming back like return of the Jedi
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
I'm no phony I'm the only real macaroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this
Amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Dies for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin' and let the music play
How ya like me now
Rap is an art and I'm a Picasso
But of course why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me again
Respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, "Ow"
She's jockin'
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test? I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy
Just like a waiter hit 'em with a place of
These fresh rhymes and make sure that he
Pays the bill, and leave him standin' still
And when he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream
Make him feel the wrath, beat him and laugh
And when I finish them, I'm gonna ask him
Who's the bests, and if he don't say Moe Dee
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
All I'm talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did how could you beat me
You're so petrified even scared to meet me
My word's the law that's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment
Just like a child never touch another mic
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
I could continue there's more on the menu
But I relax 'cos I'm so far in you
You had enough I know you're overstuffed
If I keep going you'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say back in the day
When you used to me, to my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rack me, this I vow
So all I wanna say is
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now

# 32 CYPRESS HILL - INSANE IN THE BRAIN 
Who you tryin' to get crazy with Ese?
Don't you know I'm Loco?

Leavin' your face in the grass

You know I don't take a chulo lightly

So kick that style, wicked wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip dat mainframe, I'll explain a nigga like me is goin' insane

Insane in the brain, in the brain

Like Louie Armstrong played the trumpet
I'll hit dat bong and break ya off something soon
I gotta get my props, cops come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
And underground to the next town

They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce cad
Yes I'm the pirate pilot of this ship if I get
Wit' the ultraviolet dream hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don't make your eyes strain a nigga like me is goin' insane

Insane in the membrane, insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane, insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane, went insane, got no brain
Insane in the membrane, insane in the brain

Insane in the brain
Insane in the brain
Insane in the brain

Gangstas Paradise
COOLIO - GANGSTA'S PARADISE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realise there's none left
Cause I've been brassing and laughing so long that
Even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
But I aint never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talking, and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta lope(?)
As they croak I see myself in the pistal smoke ... fool
I'm the kinda G that little homies want to be like
On my knees in the night, saying prayers in the street light


They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strip
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with my knee on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loped(?) out gangsta set trippin banger
And my homies is down so gonna rouse my anger ... fool
Death aint nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm 23 never will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.



Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them aint looking
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cooking
They say I've got to learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck ... fool



Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.

# 37 ROB BASE F/ DJ EZ ROCK - IT TAKES TWO 
Rob Base F/ DJ Ez Rock
Miscellaneous
It Takes Two
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stoopid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, I'm not the loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose 'a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it? So what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mike, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes arenot counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids--the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin'
'Cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came ot have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout--shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter--
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw upyour hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No
Oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the Back up
We're not soft, soyou better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

All right, now, EZ Rock
now, when I count to three
I want you ot get busy
You ready now? 
One, two, three, get loose now!

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

# 38 RUN D.M.C. - IT'S LIKE THAT 
Run D.M.C.
Miscellaneous
It's Like That
[Run] 
Unemployment at a record highs 
People coming, people going, people born to die 
Don't ask me, because I don't know why 
But it's like that, and that's the way it is 
 
[D.M.C.] 
People in the world tryin to make ends meet 
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet 
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 
 
[Run & D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song] 
Money is the key to end all your woes 
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows 
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes? 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
 
Bills rise higher every day 
We receive much lower pay 
I'd rather stay young, go out and play 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 
 
Wars going on across the sea 
Street soldiers killing the elderly 
Whatever happened to unity? 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
 
Disillusion is the word 
That's used by me when I'm not heard 
I just go through life with my glasses blurred 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 
 
You can see a lot in this lifespan 
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can 
You noticed one time he was your man 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
 
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade 
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid 
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh! 
 
One thing I know is that life is short 
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought 
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught? 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
 
If you really think about it times aren't that bad 
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad 
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh! 
 
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts 
For a meaning in life is why you search 
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
 
Here's another point in life you should not miss 
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh!
 
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is 
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
(Repeat these lines til fade)

# 39 TONE-LOC - WILD THING 
Let's do it
Workin' all week
9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc
She said, "You're a liar"
I said, "I got it goin' on baby doll
And I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel she said
"You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Shoppin' at the mall
Looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said
"You have plans for the night"
I said, "Hopefully if things go
Well, I'll be with you tonight"
So we journeyed to her house
One thing led to an other
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing"
Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please
Posse in effect
Hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
Still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack
She was like static cling
But that's what happens
When body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said, "Chill for now but maybe later, you'll get your chance"
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, "Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need Dollar 50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing"
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby
Wild thing

Some niggaz like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins

It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs and birds in that one house

Soon as you get it, hot skirt, there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch

We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day til we '400 Degreez'

So you can't see who we be like
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits 'cause we ain't tryin' to be Presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggaz been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin wit
'Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hah, catch your breath, now shh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggaz that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie 'em up, put 'em in the vans then put a gat in his jaws
Tch, one move blow his cactuses off
Nigga you got that llello?
Well, cook something nigga
Nigga, you let them K's go?

# 41 BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS - MY PHILOSOPHY 
So, you're a philosopher?
Yes, yes, yes, yes I think very deeply
I think very deeply, I think very deeply
I think, I think, I think very deeply
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
I think very deeply
Let's begin, what, where, why, or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact, I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, "Who is more dramatical?"
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and dis you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S C O T T
I just laughed, 'cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, my philosophy
Number one, was poetry you know it's me
This is my philosophy, many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burnin' and learn to earn respect
'Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucka MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
And we're real live, we walk correctly
A lot of suckas would like to forget me
But they can't, cause like a champ
I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just seckle
[Incomprehensible]
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say, "Start this," I am an artist
Of new concepts at their hardest
'Cause, yo, I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckas with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
But they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black
I'm brown from the Boogie Down
Productions, of course our music be thumpin'
Others say their bad, but they're buggin'
Let me tell you somethin' now about hip hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MC's be talkin' and talkin'
Tryin' to show how black people are walkin'
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug sellin'
See I'm tellin' and teaching real facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care 'cause the company is sellin' it
It's my philosophy on the industry
Don't bother dissin' me or even wish that we'd
Soften, dilute, or commercialize all our lyrics
'Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'Cause to me that's suicide self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
You're a philosopher?
Yes, I think very deeply
I think very deeply
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak
How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody says, "Don't fuck with Kris"
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny that's, Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher
It's not about a salary it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along  nor sing a song
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?
So yo, what's up, it's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
We're criminal minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checkin'
They take the album, take it home, and start sweatin'
Why? well it's simple, to them it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me?
Or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock
But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around nor do I F around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sounds? A little unrational
A lot of MC's like to use the word dramatical
Fresh for '88, you suckas

# 42 NAS - ONE LOVE 
What up kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
But fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones beach, it's bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs all the time
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say whats up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? One love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crack-heads stalkin', loud-mouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday, when I was walkin'
The nigga you shot last year
Tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'm a put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with he ask for the phone piece
Whylin' on the island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said, they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent ya flicks
Your brother's buck whilin' and four Maine, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated, your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinkin'
How can we exist through the facts?
Written in school text books, Bibles, etc
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed
So I be ghost for my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week
And hittin' Ls while I'm sleepin'
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin' terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Belle View
Or H D M, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helpin' shorty doowop
I roll two phillies together, in the prison we call them oowops
He said Nas, niggaz cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin' when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted, he starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggaz fool him
'Cos when the pistol blows the one that's murdered, be the cool one
Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
In a crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he could sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
Keep a eye out for Jake shorty, wop
One love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
...

# 43  YOUNG MC - BUST A MOVE 
Bust it

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down, 'cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous

Okay, smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next days function, high class luncheon
Food they're serving, you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wants to dance, 'cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

Some frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says, "Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow"
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next, hey, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
  (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way"

Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everythin' you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
  (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
  (Bring it down for me, fellas)

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be gettin'

So you start thinkin' then you start blinkin'
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm, 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
  (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
  (Move it, boy)

# 44 DE LA SOUL - ME MYSELF AND I 
Hit it now
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
When it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please, oh, please let Plug Two be
Himself not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
Glory, glory Hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q Tip
And he states, "Black is black"
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

# 45 GETO BOYS - MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME 
Let me drop some shit like this here
Real smooth
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother s always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin', and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the AK
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, "Take a chill, B"
But fuck that shit, there s a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm pumpin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps, checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playin' tricks on you
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had Caine but it was gold medal flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to be lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
But they're laughin' at pow pies and buried that quick
If it's goin' down let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three black, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
Because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday mornin' I'm in service
Playin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizin' that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trick or treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
We'd be in for a squab, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this was no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the nigga I'd been seein' in my sleep
So we triple teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
God damn, homie, my mind is playin' tricks on me

Verse One: 

Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me 
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me 
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman 
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever 
There are few things that's forever, my lady 
We can make war or make babies 
Back when I was nothin 
You made a brother feel like he was somethin 
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin 
Even when the skies were gray 
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay" 
Now that's real to a brother like me baby 
Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight aight 
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone 
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own 
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home 
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world 
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo 
It be true me for you that's how it is 
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz 
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses 
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please 
Be on another level of planning, of understanding 
the bond between man and woman, and child 
The highest elevation, cuz we above 
All that romance crap, just show your love 

Chorus (starts during the end of verse two, repeats until end)

# 47 50 CENT - HATE IT OR LOVE IT (G-UNIT REMIX) (FEATURING THE GAME, TONY YAYO, YOUNG BUCK & LLOYD BANKS) 
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out 'My Melody'"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggaz had stolen my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin', "Free Yayo"
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change it's stayin' the same
How many of them boys is witcha'?
When you had that little TV, you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat
Now I'm speedin', reminiscin', holdin' my weed in
Never listen if I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin, 'Easy Jesus', rockin' a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug 'bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Chorus: Ludacris, then Shawna *2X*]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, ahh ahh - you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
while the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club we can do it
in the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top
Lick it don't stop, keep the door locked while the boat rock 
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait til the show stop
or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
or in back of a classroom
how ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
see I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
and if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free 
and the tell me what they fantasy
like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
with the candle lit you give it up till they go out
or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
cause you know I got sold out
or red carpet dick could just roll out
go 'head and scream you can't hold out
we can do it in the pouring rain
runnin the train when it's hot or cold out
how 'bout in the library on top of books
but you can't be too loud
you wanna make a brother beg for it
give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
we can do it in the white house
tryna make them turn the lights out 
champaign with my campaign let me do the damn thing
what's my name, what's my name, what's my name a sauna, jacuzzi
in the back row at the movie
You can stratch my back and rule me
You can push me or just pull me
on hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
that's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, ruff sex make it hurt
in the garden all in the dir
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
on the top of my escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade; tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat! Factories or on hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game; dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

[Chorus - repeat 4X]

Bloody Mary, one two three
Sheek ain't ya usual friend, but I can set you up like Kaiser
Walk straight up the end, I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryin' to ice my whole caskit when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the Don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell him thank you Lord
Cause on Earth I was getttin' bored
Now resurect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album get back the cats that's weak
230, 6'2", need funds from you that's like a cat versus a pitbull

(clock tickin') Only time can tell how the clock tick
I really love here but I'm still a hostage
Two personallities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth, clear out the nostrals
Thinkin' death, the life seems scarey
I'm passin' graveyards, seeing people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin', till I'm out
Parash you and race my man in mild climate
Called out ten diamonds, twenty five thousand a peice
F--k streets, tryin' to own the island forget about woulin'
Tri ridin', in the car that be glidin'
If I should you were I lived you would think I was hottest
Sling dick to the chicks who that don't speak English
Wake up to Trinidad, like f---in' I'm rich
Come back, probably jet, live on set
If you can sh-t go out and spit bragoits

Monotnis, for ya'll to keep hatin'
Cause ya'll never gon' stop us, I keep my rocks spotless
And my ho-s topless, take time try to figure out who The Lox is?
Spare no one, keep rhymes like Shogun
You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own guns
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'm gon' peck you
Right before I wet you, I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special, and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' strech you
Hustilin' is dead but we still get red, turn the spots in the bakery
To give back bread, and ya'll said my money spent
But it's in the bed, so when the feds come the dogs can't get a scent
And my story, self explainitory
That I'm the hotess thing on the streets
And ya'll ain't got nothing for me

Get 'em up, spit 'em up
Red 'em up, then watch them come
Get 'em up, set 'em up
Rather do dirt then get dirt, b--ch I make ya sh-t hurt
Then step back, like I did work
This ain't no fu--in' game, what'cha think I'm playin'
Till you layin', so where the junkyard decayin'
Moms at home prayin', till you comin' home but you not
Just sittin' up in the trunk startin' to rot
And Hell is hot, only cause I'm here now baby
It's goin' down baby, peep the four pound baby
And let off up in a n--a, specially if he think he bigga

# 52 LL COOL J - I NEED LOVE 
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor, kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
I need love
Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at you're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside
I need love
I need love
I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget
I need love
I need love
See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand
And understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl
I need love
I need love
Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love

# 55 TERROR SQUAD, FAT JOE & REMY - LEAN BACK (CLEAN VERSION) 
I don't give a 'bout your fault or mishappenin's
We from the Bronx, New York thing happens
Kids clappin' love to spark the place
Half the on the Squad got a scar on they face
It's a cold world, and this is ice half a mil' for the charm, this is life
Got the phantom in front of the building Trinity Ave
10 years been legit they still figure me bad
As a youngin', was too much to cope with
Why you think, B-X nick-named me, Cook Coke
Should've been called Don, robbery, extorsion or maybe grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, on some flow Joe fat with shotty was the logo kid.
Said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now, lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
R to the Ezzy, M to the whizz-I, my arms stay breezy
The Don's stay flizz-I, got a date at 8, I'm in a 740'fizz-I've
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My Squad in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission, and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors and there really
Ain't a need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor
Reckless, check it, said it, like my necklace, started relaxin'
Now, that's what the hell I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing , we still the same , flows just changed
Now, we 'bout to change the game
Said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now, lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now
See haters get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelin's
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and
If I would've brought Compton, they'd prolly squeel
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa' real
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about da Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about da Rucker
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My champ Pee didn't have to play to win the championship
My don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said, my don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

# 56 BIG DADDY KANE - I GET THE JOB DONE 
Big Daddy Kane
It's A Big Daddy Thing
I Get The Job Done
[kane]  hey yo teddy
[riley]	yo
[kane] i ran into a young lady maliya last night
[riley] word?
[kane]	must have been her husband's payday
[riley]	heheh
[kane]	because she bought me this here brand new
Diamond link that you see me with on
[riley]	mmm
[kane]	smooth, you knowhati'msayin?  you know why?
[riley]	why kane?
[kane] cause i get the job done

Chorus: repeat 2x

"i work" (3x) "i work.. baby!"

[big daddy kane]
The question at hand, is how do i love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because i love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be ms. kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the chinese cunt
But i'll take em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like martin luther king, i shall overcome
I get the job done

Chorus (+ kane says "i get the job done!" every two lines)

[big daddy kane]
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushin to becomin some pooh-butt's wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, i let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the big daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, "oooh i like it just like debarge" (how large)
Smooth and mild i'll make you smile
Honey child and if you like then get buckwild
And when i turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, i'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..

Chorus (+ kane says "i get the job done!" every two lines)

[kane]	t.r., take it to the bridge, uhh!

[big daddy kane]
Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm brown-er than bobby so won't you be my +tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
And uhh, the date mack is ready to attack
And prove that i'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but i'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and sooth
Girl, you won't disapprove
And i promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like tyson, a captain like kirk, no
Employee of the month, cause yo, i do work
The k-a-n-e is on the j-o-b
An expert, cause i get it d-o-n-e
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done

Chorus (+ kane says "i get the job done!" every two lines)

Chorus * repeat to the end *

# 57 MC LYTE - CHA CHA CHA 
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
You can cha cha cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt as long as you let her
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide 'cuz you accidentally hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide, hypothetically speaking
Okay, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned, I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L Y T E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it, my fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night
Kick this tip
Kick this one here for me and my DJ

# 58 DIGABLE PLANETS - REBIRTH OF SLICK (COOL LIKE DAT) 
We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard rock Brooklyn kids
Us flow a rush when the DJ's boomin' classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to un thought of dimensions
Why's it so fly 'cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin' Audi
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The Puba of the styles like miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool
We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeta cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five plate
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be diggin' it with the bump verse
Us we be freakin' till dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi
Who understood yeah understood the plan
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playin' shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ax Butta how I zone, man Cleopatra Jones
And I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill
Blink, blink, blink
Think, think, think
We get ya free 'cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to goin' off
She sweats the beat and ask me 'cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us 'cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn non pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids
And I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace
Check it out man I groove like dat
I'm smmoce like dat, I jive like dat, I roll like dat
Yeah I'm thick like dat, I stack like dat
I'm down like dat, I'm black like dat
Well yo I funk like dat, I'm fat like dat
I'm in like dat, 'cause I swing like dat
We jazz like dat, we freak like dat
We zoom like dat we out

# 59 THE ROOTS - WHAT THEY DO 
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Yo, yo, lost generation, fast paced nation
World population, confront their frustration
The principles of true hip hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money making
Pretend to be cats, don't seem to know their limitations
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Giving crowds what they wantin'
Offical hip hop consumption, the 5th dumpin'
Keepin' ya party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, "Yo, we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you, you heard a bitin' ass crew but uh
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill natured, it's nothing sacred
Hey yo, it's funny when I see some rap niggaz do to make it
A few would blow up or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come wit the beautiful things and I bless the track plushly
Around the world the crowds love me from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all'a you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores you take home
To absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music runnin' through these veins
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Livin' the life of limos and lights, airplanes and trains
Short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listening start
Open your head wide and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelphi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
"To put it short I want it made like Ed", Nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the darkskin devil bred and discover
My level is that of no other and roots crew reign offical and true
While I'm continuing to
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

# 60 HOUSE OF PAIN - JUMP AROUND 
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up, punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew will act up

Get up, stand up, come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home

Feel it, funk it, amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop, sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump

I'll serve your ass like John Macenroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got psalms

And just like the prodigal son I've returned
Anyone stepping on me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle, bring a shotgun

But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega

But I ain't going out like no punk, bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the dawn of the dead

I'm coming to get ya
I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics
Homie I'll wet ya

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump

This is dedicated to Joe Da Flava

# 62 3RD BASS - POP GOES THE WEASEL 
Let's all sing, pop goes the weasel
Pop goes the, pop goes the windin' of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started rape, rappers against phony entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change
Gettin' paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop
(Pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop
(Drop drop drop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit?
I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind, it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel
(The weasel)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that got a spot in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin' like the same old Klan
Same old thieves that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure
Why score all my points in one period?
Appearin' in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin' on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel?
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
But now you're getting sued, kinda stupid
Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas to those who speak Spanish
Doin' crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the minister prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours
Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the search in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin' off the scenes of the crime smokin'
I got pub and I'ma nut like a scud see
Blowin' up like I'm throwin' up a beef patty
Sell-outs run 'bout like the measles
No cures 'cause pop goes the weasels
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel

# 63 SLICK RICK - CHILDREN'S STORY 
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah, here we go
Once upon a time, not long ago
Where people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Where laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
Me and you Tike, we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin' erratic
He said, "Keep still boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and gave him a slap
But little did he know, the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled outta gun, he said, "Why'd you hit me?"
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
I'll do years if I pull this trigger
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was running top speed till he was out of breath
Knocked and old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up a door, there guess who he saw
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap?
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run"
The dope fiend rolled back a spankin' shot gun
He went outside but there were cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doin' 83
Crashed into a tree, near university
Escaped alive, though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatered and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed the pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Point it at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "Back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only one teen in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still here him scream
This ain't funny, so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Goodnight
[Incomprehensible]
I know this story is really weird
[Incomprehensible]
Goodnight

# 64 MASE - FEEL SO GOOD 
You ready, Mase?
Party people
In the place to be
It's about that time
For us to
Yo, what you know about goin' out?
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Peeps all glittered up, stick up can, they go what?
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp, split it all
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall? Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs, always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
(You know you make me feel so good)
(You know you make me feel so good)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
(I wouldn't change you if I could)
(I wouldn't change you if I could)
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit, they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just stylishing cars 'cuz they all true Nig'
So, while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy bought
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
(You know you make me feel so good)
(You know you make me feel so good)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
(I wouldn't change you if I could)
(I wouldn't change you if I could)
Do Mase got the ladies? Yeah, yeah
Do Puff drive Mercedes? Yeah, yeah
Take hits from the 80's? Yeah, yeah
But do it sound so crazy? Yeah, yeah
Well, me personally, it's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ass cat, where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
Now, I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls that used to hardly speak
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
(You know you make me feel so good)
(You know you make me feel so good)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could

# 65 COMMON - I USED TO LOVE H.E.R. 
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, y'all and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, Common Sense is gonna drop
I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, no studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggaz had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy, I tell ya, I miss her
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, y'all and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, Common Sense is gonna drop
Now periodically, I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people, she was teaching me
By not preaching to me but speaking to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the 'Pro-black' was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R an' B, hip house, bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
'Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, y'all and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, Common Sense is gonna drop
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
But once the man got you, well, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the 'burbs licking rock and dressing hip
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping glocks, serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed but so many niggaz hit it
That she's just not the same, letting all these groupies do her
I see niggaz slamming her and taking her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hoping that the shit stop
'Cause who I'm talking 'bout y'all is hip hop

# 67 ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT - TENNESSEE 
Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losin' ground
Although I am black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic

Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull

My grandmas past, my brothers gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire
(Home)

But Lord I ask you
(Home)
To be my guiding force and truth
(Home)

For some strange reason it had to be
(Home)
He guided me to Tennessee
(Home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way

Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyes burg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young
(Home)

Go back to from where you came
(Home)
My family tree my family name
(home)

For some strange reason it had to be
(Home)
He guided me to Tennessee
(Home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Now I see the importance of history
Why people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games

I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst but I am still thirsty

The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searchin' for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Niggaz wanna try, niggaz wanna lie
Then niggaz wonder why, niggaz wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain, with mad shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggaz move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggaz, the wildest
My niggaz is with it, you want it, come and get it
Took it, then we split it, you fuckin' right, we did it
What the fuck you gonna do when we run up on you
Fuckin'  with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggaz how easily we blow niggaz
When you find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggaz
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle

Five niggaz or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam, and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage

Now it's time for bed, two more to the head

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent

In my eyes I done seen some crazy thangs in the streets
Gotta couple girl workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a girl don't know no better, I know that ain't right

Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's messed up where I live but that's just how it is
It might be new to you but it's been like this for years

It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to a lick
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out it
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard for a pimp
So I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

Niggaz hatin' on me cause I got, girls on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my girls, that's when things got harder

North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th street bound
Where people all the time end up lost and never found
Man, these girls think we prove thangs, leave a big head
They come hopin' every night, they don't end up bein' dead

Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimpin'
Gotta keep my hustle tight, makin' change off these women, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Will have a whole lot of bitches jumpin' ship

# 70 WHODINI - FREAKS COME OUT AT NIGHT 
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
Discos don't open till after dark
And it ain't till twelve till the party really starts
And I always had to be home by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin
Crowds of people lined up inside and out
Just one reason to rock the house
But in the day time the streets was clear
You couldn't find a good freak anywhere 'cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
Now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
They like to wear leather jackets, chains and spikes
They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
Real tight pants and fresh mini skirts
All kinds of colors runnin' through their hair
And you could just about find a freak anywhere
But then again, you could know someone all their life
But might not know they're a freak unless you see them at night 'cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
Now the party's jumpin', the place is packed
And when the crowd's like this, I'm ready to rap
But before I could bust a rhyme on the mic
Freaks are all over me like white on rice
Freaks come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But what I like about 'em most is that they're real good lovers
They do it in the park, they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin' hearts
You could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they don't walk, when they step, they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts
But take my advice, you don't stand a chance
Freaks are so bad, they got their own dance
So if you wanna live a nice quiet life
Do yourself a favor, don't come out at night 'cause
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
Hut one, hut two
Hut, hut, hut
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Always rappin', always clappin'
Everybody always say I'm happy
If you try to hang with me

Freaky is her
Deffer is her

Clientele is a pearl, everybody know in jail

# 72 BLACK SHEEP - THE CHOICE IS YOURS 
Who's the Black Sheep, what's the Black Sheep?
Don't know who I am or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in my sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D R E S, yes, I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey?
(Hey)
Now get a yo
(Yo)
You gotta hay?
(Huh)
It's for the hoes
(Oh)
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles, in parties where they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
Where's the Black Sheep, here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying, yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with that with no delaying
See, in actuality, one be can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
Now you can get this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, yes, for this is kinda fat
If you get with that, then you will surely miss
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life of my days
Never sweat the chaos for Black Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it, take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes, I know those for you play it
Not to be all that though all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A and W, get to the Root with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with a fly hoe, damned the scenario
And pass the paper cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony in a Beta
Dres the creator, of a style that is much greater
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at

# 73 EPMD - YOU GOTS TO CHILL 
You gots to chill
Relax your mind let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Oh, you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you're tired then go take a nap
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now I'm 'bout to shake an' bake
The E R I C K is my name I spell
Things to the clientele, yo, I rock well
I'm not an MC who' talkin' all that junk
About who can beat who soundin' like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say, check 1-2 and run down a line
To the average MC I'm known as 'The Terminator'
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroyin' a ploy when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin' your girl, why P?, 'Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene, I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on the top
In the beginnin' I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill
I be the personal computer, information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes step by step
Make 'em sound deaf to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin' still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll
I'm the P E E M D E E
And one thing I hate is a bitin' MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
'Cause M.D stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P, capital M, capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy, you gots to chill
Catch every word I'm sayin', no there's no delayin'
Don't hestitate to motivate the crowd, I'm not playin'
Seeing is believing, you catch my drift
Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift
How swift? I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin' sword
Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone
When I'm pushin' on the microphone
'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And, when it's time, issue diggum-smacks
I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin'
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol's packin'
The Pee MD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party I kill again and again
So if you're thinkin' 'bout battlin' you better come prepared
Come wit' your shield and your armoured gear
You gots to chill
DJ La Boss takes no shorts

# 74 LIL' KIM /F LIL' CEASE, NOTORIOUS B.I.G. - CRUSH ON YOU (REMIX) 
Lil' Kim /F Lil' Cease, Notorious B.I.G.
Miscellaneous
Crush On You (Remix)
Intro: Lil' Cease

Undeas (uhh... uh-huh)
Lil' Ceaser (uhh... uh-hah, Queen Bee)
Uhh (uh-huh, that's me)
Uhh, check it (Lil' Kim)

Verse One: Lil' Cease

Yo I be buyin em V's, so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage, dyin to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

        Hook: Notorious B.I.G.

I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

Aiyyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
While you count your jewels thinkin I'ma cheat you
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin things that you won't regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed?  (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade, if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me?  Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

        Hook

Verse Three: Lil' Cease, Lil' Kim

While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, all in chinchila
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit, to eat quick
Want a cheap trick?  Better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look slick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroix

        Hook (repeat 4X to fade)

# 75 PETE ROCK & CL SMOOTH - THEY REMINISCE OVER YOU (T.R.O.Y.) 
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 Years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 Years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's risin a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock and CL Smooth comin' atcha
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 Kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good God, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R-uh-O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grand mom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later

What 'U' Waiting For?
Come on! 
Jump up freak a hustle 
Do what you want but move every muscle 
Ain't no time for playing around 
Only one thing to do when you hear this sound 
Act yourself with someone else 
And make sure yourself ain't by yourself 

Dyin' to get on the dance floor 
Girl what you waiting for? 
Come on over and swing with me 
take your mind out yo' misery 
Tomorrow's gonna be another day 
Tonight, I'm gonna take it- life 
Grab the world and put it on hold 
Relax my body and rest my soul 
Feel the vibe surrounding me 
Feel the bass come down on me 

Shake your butt but don't break your back 
Tap your feet and let your fingers snap 
No matter what size shape or colour 
We can jam and enjoy each other 
Music's pumpin' I feel something 
Must be my blood and h! eartbeat thumpin 
Dispense your funds to pass through the door 
You know there's room for you on the floor 
(You don't know if they'll be any more) 
So yo, what you waiting for? 

(Chanting in background) 
"Waiting the timeless time" 

Yeah, yeah, some playin' a wall 
I wasn't with that, not livin' like that 
You ain't with it let me hear you say ho 
You ain't with it let me hear you say aaaaoooo (aaaooo) 
Ready to boogie I had on my dancin' shoes 
Ain't in the mood to be singing no blues 
So if you want to be a little disco ducka 
I came here tonight to 
So good morning, good afternoon, good night 
don't let the bedbugs bite 
Going way out when I'm aiming to please 
You havin' a good time, climb up my trees 
C'mon what you waiting for? 
C'MON what you waiting for? 

"Waiting the timeless time" 

Side to side, and just let it ride 
Give what you got, no need to hide 
You're allowed as long as your able 
Take away the chairs and move away the tables 
I'm doing my thing working around you 
Ladies screaming (We wanna house you!) 
We won't say much on this no now 
Cause I'm not quite sure that you know how 
But keep on dancin', (Keep on dancing!) 
Baby on not clockin' you, I'm just glancin' 
And what I see now is a fine figure-8 
(Don't Make me Wait) 

Yeah waiting for the DJ to play my song 
O Lord, I must have waited all night long! 
The joint was packed and it looked like a jungle, 
I felt at home, there goes my song 
S! o I hit the floor and jumped on the case, 
Sweat pouring from my face 
Clothes was wet by I didn't care 
You know what I'm saying (I know what you're sayin') 

So come on girl come on girl come on 
Let's Let's Let's Get it on 
I'm dyin' to get out on the floor 
I waited long enough; I can't wait no more! 
Come on girl come on girl come on

Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell
Nah, mean the streets are getting a little crazy
Looka, looka, looka, looka, looka
Looka, looka, looka, here, looka, shorty, got back
Should I ask her for a dance
Hold on there's too many in a wolf pack
And besides Dirtycash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to the fever
Quite as his kept, that ain't even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends
'Material Girl', living in a material world
But it's alright 'cause it's Saturday night
So Mista Funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students, bring your ouijas
Check the spelling R E F U G E E
Get the CD from Sam Goody, he he
You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad 'cause you broke
Let me clear my throat
John Forte, grab the mic, roots, sway it this way
I more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinda
Every step tango'd, your beat don't concern me
I'm eating mangoes in Trinidad wit attorneys
(Oh, yeah)
My crews slang flow worldwide like a current
Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance
Brotha do the math, you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true, you? Forget about it
Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence
Well, recognize, you a lie, trying do it
Got juice, told your lady oops, we nuts, baby
Smooth and charismatic, automatic, you gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth, baby and stay alive
Refugee camp, nuts baby
John Forte, yo, watch your lady
Yo, watch your lady
Special ill rhyme, Dirtycash
Yo, if you got more than dollar
In your pocket right now put your hands up
Yo, yo, you can tell by the way I roll shorty
That I'm a ladies man, a business man
Condos down the shore, multi million pension plans
But it ain't in my plan to make move without the fam
I keep it intact, you, 'Clef do the track
John play da mack while I pay the tax
Business as Usual watching Suspects
Steal my assets, get cut with Gillette's
We built this concept, connect like Nynex
Drinks at the bar, my American Express
Yo, I cook up, cook up, the cop a pull up, pull up
Then I cuff up, cuff up, you who's calling bluff?
Now you shook up, shook up 'cause you lock up, lock up
When I love up, love up, you, who's calling bluff?
Hey, yo, John is chilling, Dirtycash chilling
What more can I say? We living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood we be
Yeah, live at the Carnival, '97 'til infinite
Refugee All Stars

Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining, you wanna stop the shining?
You wanna stop the shining, you wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining

# 79 PM DAWN - SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS 
PM Dawn
Miscellaneous
Set Adrift On Memory Bliss
The camera pans the cocktail glass,
behind a blind of plastic plants;
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring.
then you know I can't remember a damn thing.
I think it's one of those de ja vu things,
or a dream that's tryin' to tell me something.
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it.
I don't know, I doubt it.
Subterranean by design,
I wonder what I would find if I met you,
let my eyes caress you,
until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who?
Often wonder what makes her work.
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts,
assuming that there are some out there.
they're probably alone, solitaire.
I can remember when I caught up
with a pastime intimate friend.
She said, "Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely,
but you probably don't think nothin' of me."
She was right, though, I can't lie.
She's just one of those corners in my mind,
and I just put her right back with the rest.
That's the way it goes, I guess.

Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man,
a neutron dance for a neutron fan;
marionette strings are dangerous things,
I thought of all the trouble they bring.
An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy,
rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh.
Tell me that she's not dreaming.
She's got an ace in the hole,
it doesn't have meaning.
Reality used to be a friend of mine,
'cause complete control, I don't take too kind.
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on.
Guess who's piece of the cake is Jack gone?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign.
I told her whispers in my heart were fine.
what did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do.
The next day I had the ring finger on her hand,
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan,
but I had to put her right back with the rest.
That's the way it goes, I guess.

Baby you send me...
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps upon the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robo Cop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming, the media says
"What kind of music is this for you to dance to?"
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the whack
Or the vile and the nine, keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain, need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins and you're walking, you don't just run
Black on black, remember that it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred, the summer's almost done
No time for sleep, jump in your jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people, sing it
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
I'm his number one fan, yes I am
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean
Kids all [Incomprehensible] between Gates and Green
Always says hello 'cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's mellow
'Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens and plus naked
So we owe them, so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph, you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ev Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips
Sanity Crystal, my niece and Lady Kazan, my home girl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun out, and oh yeah, sing it
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Treat me right, I'll treat you good
Well, coming back the nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps upon the scene
With a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubs on the map
'Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right, please
Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right

# 81 2 LIVE CREW - ME SO HORNY 
What'll we get for ten dollars?
Everything you want

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

Sittin' at home with my dick on hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, "Yo, this Marquis, baby, are you down with it?"

I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warnin'
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

Girls, always ask me, why I fuck so much
I say, what's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?
'Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama, if you don't tell your dad

I know, he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warnin'
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

You can say, I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say, I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowin' your mind, while you're blowin' my brains

I'm just like that man they call, Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warnin'
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny

I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're goin' out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house

You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warnin'
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny

# 82 UTFO - ROXANNE, ROXANNE 
Yo EMD
Yeah, what's up man?
There goes that girl they call Roxanne, she's all stuck up
Why you say that?
'Cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said, "Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO" and she said, "So?"
And I said, "So, I baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
'Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
'Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo"
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
'Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
You Kango, I don't think that you're dense
But you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an electric camp that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that all I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I C E
Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne
You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonair Doc
I said, "I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne"
She said, "How'd you know my name?" I said "It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief"
She said, "I've seen you before, you look like a thief"
I said, "Me, the Doc, a hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated"
Then it seemed I got busy 'cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said, "You call yourself a doctor?"  I said, "This is true"
She said, "Explain to me really what doctors must do"
I said, "This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's anesthesiology, ophthalmology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body"
She said, "Oh, that's very unique"
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date
Did you take her to the beach? That's what we planned
But she stood me up, Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne,
And here's our game plan
The beat is here, so we will reveal it
And if you think it's soft, then Roxanne feel it
Mixmaster ice

# 83 BLACK STAR - DEFINITION 
Hello everybody, recording live from somewhere
Lord, Lord have mercy
All nice an' peace an' true, follow me now, we say
Say, "Hi-Tek, yes, you're rulin' hip hop"
Say, "J. Rawls, yes, you're rulin' hip hop"
Redefinition, say, "You're rulin' hip hop"
Say, "Black Star, come to rock it"
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole an' not the half of it, vocals an' not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me an' Kweli close like Bethlehem an' Nazareth
After this you be pressin' rewind on top your master disk
Shinin' like an asterisk, for all those that be gatherin'
Connectin' like a round house, from the townhouse to the tenements
'Cause all my Brooklyn residents, [Incomprehensible] heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn, see that?
Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sellin' tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, E.Kwelity, yo' tell them where we be at
Brooklyn, New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash, we trust 'cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity, blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant, can't be covered with incense
My presence felt, my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin' MC is short hand for 'Mis Conception'
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walkin' the streets is like battlin', be careful with your body
You must know Karate or think your soul is 'Bulletproof' like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
An' maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin' an' talkin about, "I knew he'd amount to nothin'"
Neighbors like, "He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was frontin'?"
Talkin' loud like you in R.C.A, get carted away
With body parts an' trays, what a way to start your day, yo, it's like
One, two, three
Mos Def an' Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip top
Best alliance in hip hop, why oh
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac an' Biggie
Too much violence in hip hop, why oh
I said Manhattan keep on makin' it, Brooklyn keep on takin' it
So relax we're takin' it back, Redhook, where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin' not hustlin' an' bubblin'
It ain't about production an' what else we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot nosed
Colossal, true original B. Boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo
You think you the shit, somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked Buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry
Without a history of spittin' the epitome, of stupidity
Livin' my life, expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of E.Kwelity
People follow me an' other cats, they hear him flow
An' assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano
Still sippin', wishin' well, water imported from Pluto
Three hundred an' sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders, we the lions, you the cheetahs
A Cypher will complete us, if we come through your receivers
You can play us an' repeat us an' then take us home an' read us
Line for line, good Jesus, Mos Def an' Kweli
Just make a pussy freeze up, thinkin' of it ease up
One, two, three
Mos Def an' Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip top
Best alliance in hip hop, why oh
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac an' Biggie
Hold your head when the beat drop, why oh

# 84 CHAMILLIONAIRE & KRAYZIE BONE - RIDIN' 
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Now ridin' with a new chick, she like, "Hold up"
Next to the PlayStation controlla
Is a full clip and my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' ta bone, ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up and to the maximum
I got speakers, some ****** tryin' ta jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'um
We'll have a ***** locked up in a maximum, security cell
I'm grippin oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twins steady twistin' like, "Hit this dough"
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, "Who is that producin?"
That's the Play 'N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
I've been drinking and smokin'
Holy **** 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big ole Excursion swervin', all up in the curb and
A ***** been sippin' on the Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Don't wanna hold up while I puff on the blunt
I roll another one up, and leave it like we ain't givin' a ****
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40 oz. in my lap, freezin' my *****
Rollin' up a tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo' I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five says I got heat
Glock, glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, "***k 'em all"
But I won't get caught up
And brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Wonder if you want ***** it poppin' dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
You wouldn't think it so, I tried ta let cha go
Turn on my blanker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset for fa sho, 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro'
So they get behind me, tryin' ta catch my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
And denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the balla that I am, I talk to them
Not givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you then I have to cruise
Ya my number two on some old school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the laws, tell 'em, "We hate you"
I could be tough, tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm bout to pull up at your home
And it's on
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

# 86 DJ JAZZY JEFF AND THE FRESH PRINCE - PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND 
DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince
He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper
Parents Just Don't Understand
You know parents are the same

No matter time nor place

They don't understand that us kids

Are going to make some mistakes

So to you, all the kids all across the land

There's no need to argue

Parents just don't understand

I remember one year

My mom took me school shopping

It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister

All hopped in the car

We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall

My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose

I didn't say nothing at first

I just turned up my nose

She said, "What's wrong? This shirt cost $20"

I said, "Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!"

The next half hour was the same old thing

My mother buying me clothes from 1963

And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate

I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!

I said, "Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"

She said, "You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet"

I said, "Mom, let's put these clothes back, please"

She said "no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show"

I said, "This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer

Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers

But if you don't want to I can live with that but

You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks"

She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same

Inevitably the first day of school came

I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick

But my mom said, "No, no way, uh-uh, forget it"

There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax

I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts

And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought

The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought

And those who weren't laughing still had a ball

Because they were pointing and whispering

As I walked down the hall

I got home and told my Mom how my day went

She said, "If they were laughing you don't need the,

"Cause they're not good friends"

For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom

That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times

So to you all the kids all across the land

There's no need to argue

Parents just don't understand

Oh-kay, here's the situation

My parents went away on a week's vacation and

They left the keys to the brand new Porsche

Would they mind?

Umm, well, of course not

I'll just take it for a little spin

And maybe show it off to a couple of friends

I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood

Well, maybe I shouldn't

Yeah, of course I should

Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot

I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block

That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking

I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking

You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions

I honked my horn just to get her attention

She said, "Was that for me?"

I said, "Yeah"

She said, "Why?"

I said, "Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy"

She said, "How do I know you're not sick?

You could be some deranged lunatic"

I said, "C'mon toots - my name is the Prince =

Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?"

She agreed and we were on our way

She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word

We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive

We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes

She kicked her shoes off onto the floor

She said, "Drive fast, speed turns me on"

She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas

We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast

The sun roof was open , the music was high

And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh

She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far

I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car

We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche

And to make this long story short - short

When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell

I said, "I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer"

I almost had a heart attack that day

Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway

I was arrested, the car was impounded

There was no way for me to avoid being grounded

My parents had to come off from vacation to get me

I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me

My parents walked in

I got my grip, I said, "Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?"

They didn't speak

I said, "I want to plead my case"

But my father just shoved me in the car by my face

That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived

They took turns -

One would beat me while the other one was driving

I can't believe it, I just made a mistake

Well parents are the same no matter time nor place

So to you all the kids all across the land

Take it from me

Parents just don't understand

# 87 YO-YO - YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH MY YO-YO - YO YO 
Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y O Y O
Which is Yo-Yo but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by Matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprights upliftin' the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow and any show
And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft
And if you touch, you livin' in a coffin
(Word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like
But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though
I kill suckas and even hit the block
So what you wanna do? Ya must play it wrong
(Aay yo)
'Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter, than a hotter ho in snow
Tell 'em Ice Cube
(Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
What's yo name baby?
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo
But know I'm not a dunkin
As I rap, chilly chill bringin' the funk
And I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk
And he'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin
I may be buttercup or even Ms.Yo
We had dinner and know we drinkin' Cisco
Hit the slow jams, its gettin' cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin' nosy
Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, it's a sad case
So who ya man dippin' the dollars, what?
Yup, for puttin' lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya and sock ya, so why bother?
But if you come knockin' at my do'
(Ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em Ice
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah
Tell 'em what's up
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my Y O, here's my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo
Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin' like that first
Although I pack a real small gat in my purse
(Right, right)
Just no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the instructions
Just thought you wanna know about the Y O Y O
Yo, should I tell 'em Ice
They know what time it is
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s, for all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo
The simple to a metaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin', more, more
I am very versatile, changin' my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my background
Label me as a woman and sometimes I feel inferior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and dis back all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat
And stand on our own two feet
If we wanna live wit justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go
In order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed
Don't try to play me out
Lady
(Don't try to play me out)
Yay, yay, hey
(Don't try to play me out)
Yay, yay, yay, yay

# 89 WARREN G. - REGULATE 
Regulators, we regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too but you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean
Earn your keep, regulators, mount up
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said, "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said, "What's up?"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said, "I'm stuck"
Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said, "Damn, what's next?"
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head, I think, I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate
I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help the Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "Ooo I like your size"
She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings
We brings melody
G-Funk, where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm
If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

# 90 BIZ MARKIE - JUST A FRIEND 
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and gues who I met
I whispered in her ear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof"
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, "How do you like the show?" 
she said, "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, "Do ya have a man," she tried to pretend
She said, "No I don't, I only have a friend"
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact 
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some undderstanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
i called her room, a guy picked up and then i called again
I said, "Yo, who was that?" "Oh, he's just a friend"
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I as on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I say
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

# 91 EVE - WHO'S THAT GIRL?

Look into my eyes, think I want you, can't tell
Me I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now, 'cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch, check what I've been through
Got mine took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dawg I'm ownin' dot coms
Who's that girl?
  (La, la, la)
Eve's that girl
  (La, la, la)
Who's that girl?
  (La, la, la)
Eve's that girl
  (La, la, la)
Yo, yo I can understand why you're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me
Huh, mad cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You go the best here
Come on try your luck shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin' vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down I get down for this paper
Sixteen lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line my world, my way any questions
Who's that girl?
  (La, la, la)
Eve's that girl
  (La, la, la)
Who's that girl?
  (La, la, la)

Uh, yo power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch

I was born to shine while most of y'all was borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless
Dispose the flow through my hands like water
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch swallow it up, while I shove it down
Make em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me, I ain't to blame
Back to plan B baby, I can feel your pain
Who's that girl?
  (La, la, la)
Eve's that girl
  (La, la, la)

we're gonna give you what you never had
my tag is rap
we will never slack we're in effect
and that you can bet
when my hip drum's swayin'
and the bass starts playin'
some said "rap is crap"
I disagree with that
so jack stand back
cause we're gonna crack this track
to all the nonbelievers
well you better believe it mack
cause the rap gang is back
and it's time for the real rap

# 95 Craig Mack Flava In Ya Ear
Yo Mack I don't even UNDERSTAND how they didn't understand you in
that Mary joint!"
"Yeah I know man."
"Kick that ol' robotic futuristic George Jetson CRAZY JOINT!!"
Just...like... Uniblab robotic kickin' flab
My flavor be the badder
chitter chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter (1)
I bet you my shit come out fatter

to turn your body into antimatter (2) {...body into antimatter...}
And just like a piece of sizzlean

No more of your whining
on the charts climbing
as I make the funk
kickin' out more harder than a diamond {...harder than a diamond}
And if you didn't know who's rhyming

Brother FREEZE! {BOY!...}
Man's indisputed
and deep-booted
funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad M.C.
with stamina like Bruce Jenner(3)

Tasting M.C.'s for dinner
You're crazy like that glue {...you're crazy, boy, You're crazy.}
to think that you
could out-do

that's sick like the flu {...shake 'em down, Mack}
BOY, I flip
BOY all the time, 'cause

Seems like there's no competition
in this rap world expedition
You come around,

{Flavor in ya ear, boy...}
HAAAAAAA!
The Mack's dope
With more hope than your Pope
but for M.C.'s more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down
down-breakin'
forsaken
lords of M.C.'s shakin
with this track that my man's makin'
M.C.'s will run like a bomb threat
I bet {what?}
or better yet {huh?}

Gettin' hotter than the sun get {yup!}
Craig Mack is the flav that romps
from here to Tibet {BOY!}
I break all rules
with my action
that the Mack sends
to M.C.'s stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town's
gettin' down
leavin' bodies buried in the ground {...rest in peace...}
I set up rhymes for a decoy
To off a bad boy {OOOhhhh!}
Watch the M.C.'s I destroy and.... {BOY!!}
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear

# 96 Coolio 2 Minutes & 21 Seconds Of Funk
Yeah, yeah
Fuck all these niggaz
You know what i'm talkin' about wino
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Two minutes and twenty-one seconds of funk
And i ain't no punk
That's right, that's right
A tisket a tasket
That's all you ask it
Snap your cd and drop the pieces in your casket
Like little jack horna', i'm still bendin' cornas'
Buckin' shots on your block, i'm sippin' on corona's
Uh, your mcdonald had a farm wit' a six-fo on suicide
Sittin' in the barn wit' no alarm
Straight up collected it, cool and calm
Crowbar in my hand and my skeleton brick still works like a charm
Who's the rawest?
My shit is flawless
Had to be passin' out bruises,
Lacerations and broken jawses
Emcees wanna floss you better understand who's the boss
Before i do a michael jackson and "cut your shit off!"
Part of the penitentary still, penetratin' your grill
I keep on keepin' it right, while you keep on keepin' it real
I'll bring the treble and the bass to delapatate your waist
Coolio's on the case, get yo hoe out my face, fool
Lodi dodi, i don't know karate, but i know a razor
And none of y'all can't fade me
I know you wanna try to play me
And busta's wanna playa hate me
I'm one of the dopest niggaz out i
Guess that's why they hate me
Cause i slang hits like niggaz slang cavi
I remain like khakis, i guess that's why they mad at me
On a record you might outgat me
But you can't outrap me
My shit is fatta'
And yo shit need a little bit mo batta'
Freestyle in unrestricted manner or method
Free funk text readily selected, so check it
Uh, ?dip diver?, socializer, i've been rockin'
These motherfuckin' microphones since nineteen seventy-niner,
And by the time that this little nappy head nigga retire
I'ma be at the ripe ol' age of forty-eight or forty-niner
My shit is wise, cpt m.c. for hire
My name ain't rick james but i'll burn your ass with a fire
So, what's your desire baby love?
Is it hands wrapped around mics
Or fingers wrapped around triggas?
Eitha' way it go i'm dumpin' and i'm dippin'
Still tennis shoe pimpin', 40 thevz in position
Fee-fi-fo-fum, now nigga i'm a giant
And yo ass is like jack,
But yo magic beans is wack
Skills is what you lack
I'm like a benz, you ain't even like cadillac
You mo like a regal
I'ma pit bull, and you's a beagle
I'm set to strangle hangin' emcee's at all angles
As their legs start to dangle,
Dance around everybody like mr. bo jangles
Los angeles, compton, long beach, and carson hawthorne
Livin with the watts
I'm sendin' out shout outs
I used to drink ol' gold
Now i just stroll
Straight to the ?exit? section of my neighborhood liquor store
Huh, and you know what make me laugh, bitch?
Even your mama want my autograph, autograph, autograph,
Autograph, autograph

I watch boxing matches an a football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress, but I love to sing
I like going out, taking walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home, curl up next to ya
Though I aint a virgin that don't mean I'm having sex wit ya
Everywhere I go I'm spotted(For real and that's no question)
And everything I want I got it(No fronting and no guessin)

Smile like the sunrise(Body like heaven)
Anywhere I go I'm spotted(For real and that's no question)
And everything I want I got it(No fronting and no guessin)
5'5 with brown eyes(Caramel complected)
Smile like the sunrise(Body like heaven)
Baby look me in the eyes
And tell me if
I'm the kinda girl you like
I'm feeling you
'Cause baby you're my kindda guy(That's what it is)
Thinking about you and I
I wanna run with this
All night long
And if you want me we can keep this going
Let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent I'm aint like some other women
Anywhere I go I'm spotted(For real and that's no question)

Ven aqui, Ven aqui Mama
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
See we could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping Cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5 brown eyes with your thick thighs
Everytime I see your smile it's got me hypnotized
Mira (so can I get your number?)
Mi amor mira me bien
Te encantara si quisieras lo tendras(I don't know what you said, but I like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada
Lo que que me hayo me consigo
Piel morena, ojos negros
Y sonrisa soleada
Anywhere I go I'm spotted(For real and that's no question)
And everything I want I got it(No fronting and no guessin)
5'5 with brown eyes(Caramel complected)
Smile like the sunrise(Body like heaven) [4x]
