# 1 Justin Timberlake - Mirrors
Arent you somethin to admire cause your shine is somethin like a mirror
And I cant help but notice you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that Im always parallell on the other side
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you theres no place we couldnt go
Just put your hand on the glass Ill be tryin to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
Cause I dont wanna lose you now
Im lookin right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And Ill tell you baby it was easy
Comin back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
Its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldnt get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now its clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
Cause its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me staring back at me
Arent you somethin an original cause it doesnt seem merely assembled
And I cant help but stare cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I cant ever change without you you reflect me I love that about you
And if I could I would look at us all the time
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you theres no place we couldnt go
Just put your hand on the glass Ill be tryin to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
Cause I dont wanna lose you now
Im lookin right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And Ill tell you baby it was easy
Comin back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
Its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldnt get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now its clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
Cause its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me staring back at me
Yesterday is history
Tomorrows a mystery
I can see you lookin back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby keep your eyes on me
Cause I dont wanna lose you now
Im lookin right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And Ill tell you baby it was easy
Comin back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
Its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldnt get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now its clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
Cause its like youre my mirror
My mirror staring back at me staring back at me
You are you are the love of my life
Baby youre the inspiration for this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me its already gone
And I cant wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know you are
You are you are the love of my life
Girl youre my reflection all I see is you
My reflection in everything I do
Youre my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection in everything I do
You are you are the love of my life

# 2 Taylor Swift - 22
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeaaaah
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines its time uh uh
I dont know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were 22 22
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks its time uh uh
I dont know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were 22 22
I dont know about you 22 22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We wont be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you I gotta have you
I dont know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were 22 22
Dancing like 22 yeah 22 yeah yeah
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We wont be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you I gotta have you

And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying

# 4 Bruno Mars – When I Was Your Man Lyrics
Same bed but it feels just
A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio
But it dont sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That I Should of bought you flowers
And held you hands
Should of gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But shes dancing with another man
My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
Cause the good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made
Ooh and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That I Should of bought you flowers
And held your hands
Should of gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But shes dancing with another man
Although it hurts
Ill be the first to say
That I was wrooooong
Oooh I know im probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he hold you hands
Give you all hes hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much
You loved to dance
Do all the things I should of done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should of done
When I was your man

# 5 Rihanna – Stay Lyrics (feat Mikky Ekko)
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
He said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Its not much of a life youre living
Its not just something you take its given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny youre the broken one but Im the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light its hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay
I want you to stay ohhh

# 6 Pitbull – Feel This Moment Lyrics (Feat Christina Aguilera)
Ask for money and get it viced
Ask for advice get money twice
Im from the Dirty but that chico nice
Yall call it a moment I call it life
One day when the light is glowing
Ill be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (whaooo)

I just wanna feel this moment
Mr Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita come on dale que la cosa esta rica
 (I wanna feel this moment)
Feel this moment…
Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from the hard ways
Bill sos and oh yeas
They count it always 305 all day
Now baby we can party oh baby we can party
She read books especially about red rooms and tight ups
I got it hooked cause she seen me in a suit with a red tie tied up
Meet and greet nice to meet ya but time is money
Only difference is I own it now lets stop time and enjoy this moment
One day when the light is glowing
Ill be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (whaooo)
I just wanna feel this moment (whaooo)
Feel this moment…
I see the future but live for the moment make sense dont it
Now make dollars I mean billions im a genius I mean brilliant
This street is what scoot em
And made em slicker to slick with the ruler
Ive lost a lot and learned a lot
But im still undefeated like Zula
Im far from cheap I break down companies with alll my peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And not given view and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it like a stop watch lets stop time and enjoy this moment
One day when the light is glowing
Ill be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (whaooo)
I just wanna feel this moment (whaooo)
I just wanna feel this moment
Come one feel this moment…
(whaooo) I just wanna feel this moment
(whaooo) I just wanna feel this moment

Yall sit back and enjoy the light show

Years of distress tears on the dress

This is trouble season time for tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
Ill show you how to do this young
No papers catch favors
Get high out Vegas
Who says these devils aint looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
Didnt lose a daughter got a son

And as long as Ive got my suit and tie
Ima leave it off on the floor tonight

All dressed up in black and white

Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things show you a few things
Let me show you a few things 
show you a few things about love
now that were in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things show you a few things

# 8 Pink – Just Give Me A Reason (feat Fun)
Right from the start
You were a thief – you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That werent all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now youve been talking in your sleep
Oh oh
Things you never say to me
Oh oh
Tell me that youve had enough
Of our love our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Its in the stars
Its been written in the scars on our hearts
Were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Im sorry I dont understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And its all in your mind
Yeah but this is happening
Youve been having real bad dreams
Oh oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh oh
Theres nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love our love oh our love our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Its in the stars
Its been written in the scars on our hearts
Were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just a second 
I never stopped
Youre still written in the scars on my heart
Youre not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
Oh tears ducts and rust
Ill fix it for us
Were collecting dust but our loves enough
Youre holding it in
Youre pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
Well come clean
Just give me a reason
Just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Its in the stars
Its been written in the scars on our hearts
Were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bits enough
Just a second were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Its in the stars
Its been written in the scars on our hearts
Were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh oh
We can learn to love again
Oh oh
We can learn to love again
And were not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Hey Macklemore? Can we go thrift shopping?

Dressed in all pink cept my gator shoes those are green

# 11 Calvin Harris – Sweet Nothing Lyrics (feat Florence Welch)
You took my heart and you had it in your mouth
And with the word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper its the worst empty though by a single word
There is a hollow in me
So I put my faith in something unknown
Im living on such sweet nothing
But Im trying to hope with nothing to hold
Im living on such sweet nothing
And its hard to live
And its hard to love
When youre giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing sweet nothing
Youre giving me such sweet nothing
It isnt easy for me to let it go
Cause
I swallow every single word
And
Every whisper every sigh
It swept this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me
So I put my faith in something unknown
Im living on such sweet nothing
But Im trying to hope with nothing to hold
Im living on such sweet nothing
And its hard to live
And its hard to love
When youre giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing sweet nothing
Youre giving me such sweet nothing
And its not enough
To tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing

# 12 Demi Lovato – Heart Attack
Puttin my defences up
Cause I dont wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think Id have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you Im never good enough
When I dont care
I can play em like a Ken doll
Wont wash my hair
Then make em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yeah its you make me so nervous
Then I just cant hold your hand
You make me glow but I cover up
Wont let it show so Im
Puttin my defences up
Cause I dont wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think Id have a heart attack (x3)
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around I get paralyzed
And everytime I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
Its just not fair
Pains more trouble than it all is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
For you make me so nervous
Then I just cant hold your hand
You make me glow but I cover up
Wont let it show so Im
Puttin my defences up
Cause I dont wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think Id have a heart attack (x3)
The feelings I lost in my love
Theyre burning Im not giving up
And theres no one else to blame
So instead Ill take off in a run
Im playing too close to the sun
And Im burst into flames
You make me glow but I cover up
Wont let it show so Im
Puttin my defences up
Cause I dont wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think Id have a heart attack (x5)

# 13 Swedish House Mafia – Dont You Worry Child (feat John Martin)
There was a time I used to look into my fathers eyes
In a happy home I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake 
Thats where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Dont you worry dont you worry child
See heavens got a plan for you
Dont you worry dont you worry now
Yeah!
Dont you worry dont you worry child
See heavens got a plan for you
Dont you worry dont you worry now
Yeah!
There was a time I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world thought Ill never lose her out of sight 
We were so young I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake 
Thats where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Dont you worry dont you worry child
See heavens got a plan for you
Dont you worry dont you worry now
Yeah!
Dont you worry dont you worry child
See heavens got a plan for you
Dont you worry dont you worry now
Yeah!
Ooh ooh ooh oh!
See heavens got a plan for you
Ooh ooh ooh oh!
Yeah!

Youre a troublemaker
Youre a troublemaker
You aint nothing but a troublemaker girl
You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip

After a drink or two
I was putty in your hands
I dont know if I have the strength to stand

And make me forget my name

And youll show up again next summer

# 15 Taylor Swift – I Knew You Were Trouble
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
No apologies hell never see you cry
Pretend he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

# 16 Krewella – Alive Lyrics
Lets make this fleeding moment last forever
So tell me what youre waiting for?
Im gonna keep it frozen here forever 
Theres no regretting anymore
Its worth to wait even so far away
Im making the night mine until the day I die
No lights to brake when youre hanging right here
You know what it feels like when youre dancing blind
Oh oh just a beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
Keep the song where the beat is on control
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
Meet me under shining lights 
Ive been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you cant deny that youre living open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on feel me until the pain dont matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what Ive been chasing after
Oh oh just a beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
Keep the song where the beat is on control
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
Oh oh just a beat inside my soul
Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
Keep the song where the beat is on control
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive
Feel alive feel alive alive alive alive
Alive! Feel alive!

# 17 Icona Pop – I Love It (feat Charli XCX)
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge
I dont care I love it I dont care
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge
I dont care I love it I dont care
Youre on a different road Im in the milky way
You want me down on earth but I am up in space
Youre so damn hard to please we gotta kill this switch
Youre from the 70′s but Im a 90′s bitch
I love it!
I love it!
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge
I dont care I love it
I dont care I love it I love it
I dont care I love it I dont care
Youre on a different road Im in the milky way
You want me down on earth but I am up in space
Youre so damn hard to please we gotta kill this switch
Youre from the 70′s but Im a 90′s bitch
I dont care I love it
I dont care I love it I love it
I dont care I love it
I dont care I love it I love it
I dont care
I love it

# 18 Macklemore – Cant Hold Us 
Return of the Mack get up! what it is what it does what it is what it isnt
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
Get up! fresh out pimp strut walking little bit of humble little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and cosby sweatergang nope nope yall cant copy
Yup Bad moonwalking this here is our party my posses been on broadway 
And we did it our way
Grown music I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet Im on~
Let that stage light go and shine on down got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds 
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler 
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack fat cat crushing
Labels out here 
Nah they cant tell me nothing
We give that to the people 
Spread it across the country
Labels out here 
Nah they cant tell me nothing
We give it to the people 
Spread it across the country
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
Nah can I kick it? thank you yeah Im so damn grateful
I grew up really wanted gold fronts
But thats what you get when wu tang raised you
Yall cant stop me go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And Im eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw Tell me go up Gone!
deuces goodbye I got a world to see and my girl she wanna see Rome 
Ceasar make you a believer nah I never ever did it for a throne
that validation comes from giving it back to the people nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall they got me then from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
na na na na na na na na
and all my people say
Ma-kle-more
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
Can we go back this is the moment
Tonight is the night well fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

# 20 Mumford & Sons – I Will Wait 
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell Heavy into your arms
These days of dust 
Wish we wouldve known 
Will blow away with this new sun
But Ill kneel down wait for now
Ill kneel down know my ground
I will wait I wait wait for you
And I will wait I wait wait for you
So bring my step
And relent you forgave and I wont forget
Know what weve seen
And him with less
knowing some way to shake the excess
I will wait I will wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you
Now Ill be bold as well as strong
And use my head along side my heart
So tame my flesh and fix my eyes
a tethered mind freed from the lies
But Ill kneel down wait for now
Ill kneel down know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
Bow my head feel my heart slow
I will wait I wait wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you
And I will wait I will wait for you

# 21 Fall Out Boy- My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark 
Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
B-B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark dark
Cant be sure when theyve hit their mark mark
And besides in the mean mean time
Im just dreaming of tearing you apart
Im in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out of the cage
Im a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up
Light em up up up
Light em up up up
Im on fire
So light em up up up
Light em up up up

Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
In the dark dark
Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa
In the dark dark
Writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died
Ive got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That youre the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up
Light em up up up
Light em up up up
Im on fire
So light em up up up
Light em up up up
Light em up up up
Im on fire

# 22 PRINCE - WHEN DOVES CRY 
Dig if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling, can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when the doves cry
Touch if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
Don't cry
Oh yeah all right, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah
When doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry
Ah, ah, ah, ooo
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooo
When doves cry, don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry

# 23 BRITNEY SPEARS - ...BABY ONE MORE TIME 
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're outta sight
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Now, boy you got me blinded
I bet you baby
There's nothing that I would not do, no
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my lonliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
I must confess that my lonliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

# 24 QUEEN - BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY 
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
Mama, ooh
(Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro)
Magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
(Never never never never let me go!)
Will not let you go!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

# 25 ROY ORBISON - OH, PRETTY WOMAN 
Pretty woman, walkin' down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman
I don't believe you
You're not the truth
No one can look as good as you
Mercy
Pretty woman, oh won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman
You look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me
Pretty woman stop a while
Pretty woman talk a while
Pretty woman give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah
Pretty woman walk my way
Pretty woman say you'll stay, with me
'Cuz I need you, I'll treat you right
Come to me baby, be mine tonight
Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman
Don't walk away hey, okay
If that's the way it must be okay
I guess I'll go on home it's late
Maybe tomorrow night but wait
What do I see
Is she walking back to me?
Yeah, she's walking back to me
Oh, pretty woman

# 26 ELTON JOHN - YOUR SONG 
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
But I'm, I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I, I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling shows
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
So you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

# 27 MARVIN GAYE - WHAT'S GOING ON 
Mother, Mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah
Father, Father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
Oh, what's going on? what's going?
Ya, what's going on? ah, what's going on?
Mother, Mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long?
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
Oh, what's going on? yeah what's going on?
Tell me what goin'  on? I'll tell you what's going on?

# 28 VAN MORRISON - BROWN EYED GIRL 
Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog
With our, our hearts a-thumpin'
And you, my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a-slidin'
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
Do you remember when
We used to sing?
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
Just like that
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
La te da
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
Do you remember when
We used to sing?
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
  (Lyin' in the green grass!)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
  (Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
  (Sha la la la la, la la la la, la te da, la te da, la te da, da da da)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da

# 29 HANSON - MMMBOP 
You have so many relationships in this life
Only one of two will last
You're going through all this pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
So hold on to the ones that really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop

Mmm bop, ba duba dop

Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop

In an mmm bop they're gone. In an mmmbop
they're not there.
In an mmmbop they're gone. In an mmmbop 
they're not there.
Until you lose your hair. But you don't care.

Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me if it's going to be a daisy or a rose?
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.

# 30 FLEETWOOD MAC - GO YOUR OWN WAY 
Fleetwood Mac
Rumours
Go Your Own Way
(Lindsey Buckingham)

Loving you
Isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things
That I feel

If I could
Maybe I'd give you my world
How can I
When you won't take it from me

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You an call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up
Shacking up is all you wanna do

If I could
Baby I'd give you my world
Open up
Everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You an call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
go your own way

# 31 BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - BORN TO RUN 
In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and stepping out over the line
Baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We got to get out while we're young
Because tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in, I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs around these velvet rims 
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run until we drop, baby we'll never go back
Will you walk with me out on the wire
Because baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I got to find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Girl, I want to know if love is real

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Someday girl I don't know when we're going to get to that place
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
But until then tramps like us, baby we were born to run

# 32 SANTANA - SMOOTH 
Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu equita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
Yea
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name callin' me out
Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
And just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
(Gimme your heart make it real)
Or else forget about it
(yeah)
Let's don' forget about it
(Oh, no, no)
   (Oh)
Let's don' forget about it

Let's don' forget about it
(yeah)
(Ahh, Ohh)
Let's don' forget about it
(Yeah, yeah)

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
And you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

# 34 TLC - WATERFALLS 
A lonely mother gazining out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cuz he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body layin' cold in the gutter
Listen to me, don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body
Can't handle but all he can say is
Baby is good to me
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't you hear me, don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast, but I think you're moving too fast
Come on, I seen a rainbow yesterday
But to many storms have come and gone
Leaving a trace of not one God giving ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise him for the seven days
And like his promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional
Skies have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries, my only bleeding hope
Is for the folk who can't cope with such an endurin' pain
That it keeps them in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tootin' caine into your own vein?
What a shame you shoot and aim for some one else's blame
You claim the insane for this day and time for falling
Prey to crime I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

I would only be in your way. 
So I'll go, but I know 
I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way. 

And I will always love you. 
I will always love you. 
You, my darling you. Hmm. 

Bittersweet memories 
that is all I'm taking with me. 
So, goodbye. Please, don't cry. 
We both know I'm not what you, you need. 

And I will always love you. 
I will always love you.

# 37 DAVID BOWIE - CHANGES 
Oh yeah
Mmm
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Don't want to be a richer man)
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Just gonna have to be a different man)
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Don't tell them to grow up and out of it)
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Where's your shame, you've left us up to our necks in it)
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers)
Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Pretty soon now you're gonna get older)
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

# 38 OTIS REDDING - (SITTING ON THE) DOCK OF THE BAY 
Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening come
Watching the ships roll in
And I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
I have nothing to live for
Look like nothings gonna come my way
So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remain the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess, I'll remain the same, yes
Sitting here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
Sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

# 39 NAUGHTY BY NATURE - OPP 
Naughty By Nature
Miscellaneous
Opp
O.P.P.
------
by Naughty By Nature

Harm me with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em    


OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P...well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

Chorus:
   You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
   You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it...ah...sorta properly
I say the last P...hmmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me  
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

Chorus:
   You down with OPP    (Yeah you know me)  3X
   Who's down with OPP  (Every last lady)
   You down with OPP    (Yeah you know me)  3X
   Who's down with OPP  (All the ladies)

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's  
that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, "Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave"
She said, "Oh no, I love you Treach" I said, "Now child please"
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it

Chorus:
   You down with OPP   (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP (This whole party)
   You down with OPP   (Yeah you know me) 3X
   Who's down with OPP (This whole party)

Break it down!

# 40 ALANIS MORISSETTE - IRONIC 
An old man turned ninety-eight
He won a lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
Well, isn't this nice? Isn't this ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought it figures

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And ya well life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife
Isn't it ironic don't you think a little too ironic and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought it figures

# 41 ERIC CLAPTON - TEARS IN HEAVEN 
Would you know my name
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in Heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in Heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in Heaven?
I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in Heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you beggin' please, beggin' please
Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in Heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would you be the same
If I saw you in Heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in Heaven

# 42 PRINCE - LITTLE RED CORVETTE 
I guess I shoulda known
By the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb
'Cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say what have I got to lose?
And honey I say
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette, you need a love that's gonna last
I guess I shoulda closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cuz I felt a little ill
When I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not
I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast, yes, you are
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last, how long?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cuz it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last
Little red Corvette, honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't you gonna run into [Incomprehensible]
Little red Corvette, right down to the ground
(Honey you got to slow down)
You, you, got to slow down
Little red Corvette, you're movin' much too fast
Too fast, you need to find a love that's gonna last
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen
And the ride, I say the ride is so smooth
You must be a limousine
Baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette, you need a love
You need a love that's ah, that's gonna last
Little red Corvette, you got to slow down
(You got to slow down)
Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't, 'cuz if you don't
You gonna run your body right into the ground
Right into the ground, right into the ground
Right into the ground, little red Corvette

# 43 PEARL JAM - JEREMY 
At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun, arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Father didn't give attention, oh
And the boy was something that mother wouldn't wear
King Jeremy, the wicked, oh, ruled his world
Clearly I remember pickin' on the boy, seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion, yeah
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard
Father didn't give affection, no
And the boy to the fact that mother didn't care
King Jeremy, the wicked, oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this, try to forget this
Try to erase this, try to forget this
From the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today

# 44 SMOKEY ROBINSON & THE MIRACLES - THE TRACKS OF MY TEARS 
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Outside, I'm masquerading
Inside, my hope is fading
Just a clown, ooh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile, looks out of place
Yeah just a closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Police
Synchronicity
Every Breath You Take

Every game you play, every night you stay

# 46 THE ROLLING STONES - MISS YOU 
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you"
"We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"
Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?
I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, "What's the matter with you boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say
I won't miss you child
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't keep you child
You've been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child

# 47 BOB DYLAN - TANGLED UP IN BLUE 
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
I was layin' in bed
Wonderin' if she changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standin' on the side of the road, rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
Then she turned around to look at me as I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue
She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue

# 48 CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL - PROUD MARY 
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

# 49 ABBA - DANCING QUEEN 
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat
From the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

# 53 THE WALLFLOWERS - ONE HEADLIGHT 
So long ago I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste
She always had a pretty face
I wondered why she hung around this place
Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight
She said it's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sign up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all is good and nothingness is dead
Run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge
Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight
Well this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
These city walls of dying dreams
I think her death it must be killing me
Hey, hey, hey! Come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight

# 54 FASTBALL - OUT OF MY HEAD 
Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheel
The wheel of possibility however it may roll
Give it a spin see if you can somehow factor in
You know there's always more than one way
To say exactly what you mean to say
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication it was hard to find
Don't matter what I say only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication it was hard to find
Don't matter what I say only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an invitation it was hard to find
Don't matter what I say only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too

# 55 STEVIE WONDER - YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE 
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, yeah, yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be Heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart, yeah
You are the sunshine of my life, baby
That's why I'll always stay around

# 56 GEORGE MICHAEL - FAITH 
Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Because I got to have faith
Oh yeah, faith
Got to have faith
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

# 57 BILLY JOEL - JUST THE WAY YOU ARE 
Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ah, what will it take till you believe in me?
The way that I believe in you?

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

# 58 THE TEMPTATIONS - JUST MY IMAGINATION (RUNNING AWAY WITH ME) 
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to me
But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Soon, soon we'll be married and raise a family
A cozy, little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Every night, on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die"
Her love is Heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
I never met her, but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

# 59 GLORIA GAYNOR - I WILL SURVIVE 
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?

# 60 THE GO-GO'S - OUR LIPS ARE SEALED 
Can you hear them
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well that's no surprise
Can you see them
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Careless talk
Through paper walls
We can't stop them
Only laugh at them
Spreading rumors
So far from true
Dragged up from the underworld
Just like some precious pearl
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
There's a weapon
We must use
In our defense
Silence
When you look at them
Look right through them
That's when they'll disappear
That's when you'll be feared
Hush, my darling
Don't you cry
Quiet, angel
Forget their lies

# 61 THE BEATLES - IN MY LIFE 
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more

# 62 THE BEACH BOYS - GOOD VIBRATIONS (VOL. 3) 
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm picking up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
Good bop bop, good vibrations
Bop bop, excitations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Close my eyes, she is somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm picking up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
Good bop bop, good vibrations
Bop bop, excitations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
I, my, my
I don't know where but she sends me there
Oh, my, my, my, what a sensation
Oh, my, my, what elation
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening

# 63 EMINEM - MY NAME IS 
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady

# 66 MADONNA - PAPA DON'T PREACH 
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, Daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe
Please
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe, we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up

# 67 DEPECHE MODE - JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH 
When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

Just can't seem to get enough

# 68 CYNDI LAUPER - TIME AFTER TIME 
Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in the circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
You said "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

We'll kill the fatted calf tonight

Solid walls of sound

To find who's right and who's wrong

She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, is crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cos I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart
And I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standin' in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts
Now I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
Free fallin', now I'm, free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm, free fallin', now I'm
I wanna glide down over Valhalla

Gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while
Now I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin' oh
Free falling
Yeah I'm free, oh free fallin'

# 72 LL COOL J - I NEED LOVE 
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor, kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
I need love
Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at you're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside
I need love
I need love
I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget
I need love
I need love
See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand
And understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl
I need love
I need love
Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I'll be waiting, I love you

# 73 ELTON JOHN - TINY DANCER 
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The Boulevard is not that bad
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
But oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen

Hold me closer tiny dancer

Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway

# 78 GREEN DAY - LONGVIEW 
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
And I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit
I've got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for the motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone but no one's callin'
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost it's fun
You're fuckin' lonely
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I was slippin' away to paradise
Some say, "Quit or I'll go blind"
But it's just a myth

I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?

She's running out the door
She's running
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you

# 82 WHAM! - CARELESS WHISPER 
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance's kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
What am I without your love?
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?

Feel the heat, feel the beat, all night
Rock you into day sunlight

# 85 CHEAP TRICK - SURRENDER 
Mother told me, yes, she told me, I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch"
Well, just the other day I heard a soldier falling off
Some Indonesian junk that's going round

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay

Father says, "Your mother's right, she's really up on things
Before we married, mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines
Now, I had heard the WACS recruited old maids for the war
But mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years


Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay

Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?
When I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, got my Kiss records out

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay
Away, away

Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away

# 86 BRANDY & MONICA - THE BOY IS MINE 
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh hu sure you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah you do too, but I just wanted to know
Do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no no he's mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane?
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it's 'cause it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
You're the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

# 87 HUMAN LEAGUE - DON'T YOU WANT ME 
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you
When you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you
When you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

Foreigner
Agent Provocateur
I Want To Know What Love Is
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is

I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide

I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me
Show me love is real, yeah

# 92 BLACKSTREET - NO DIGGITY 
Hey, yeah ya know what?
I like the players
No diggity, no doubt
Play on play that
Play on play that
Yo Dre drop the verse
It's going down fad to Blackstreet
The homeys got abby collar creations funk like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, ass out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ig-asms with my mellow accent
Still moving his flavor with the homeys Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds got game by the pound
Gettin' paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

No diggity, I got to bag it up
She's got class and style
Street knowledge, buy the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching villains is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, everyday
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby I can get you with my ride
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

# 94 SOFT CELL - TAINTED LOVE 
Soft Cell
Miscellaneous
Tainted Love
Sometimes I feel I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away
>From the pain you drive into the heart of me.
The love we share seems to go nowhere,
And I've lost my life,
For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.

Chorus:
Once I ran to you, now I run from you.
This tainted love you've given,
I gave you all a boy could give you.
Take my tears and that's not really all. . .
Tainted love, ohh, tainted love

Now I know I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away.
You don't really want any more from me.
To make things right you need someone to  hold you tight,
And you think love is to pray,
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

Chorus

Don't touch me please, I cannot stand the way you tease.
I love you though you hurt me so.
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go.

Ohh, tainted love (repeat)

Touch me baby, tainted love (repeat & fade out)

# 96 BIZ MARKIE - JUST A FRIEND 
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and gues who I met
I whispered in her ear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof"
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, "How do you like the show?" 
she said, "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, "Do ya have a man," she tried to pretend
She said, "No I don't, I only have a friend"
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact 
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some undderstanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
i called her room, a guy picked up and then i called again
I said, "Yo, who was that?" "Oh, he's just a friend"
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I as on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I say
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

# 97 DEF LEPPARD - PHOTOGRAPH 
I'm outta luck, outta love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one, I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done
Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough
I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild so free and far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you
Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
You've gone straight to my head
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you
Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
I wanna touch you, oh
Photograph
Photograph, your photograph
Photograph
Photograph, I need only your
Photograph, I'm outta love
Photograph, I'm outta love
Photograph, you're the only one
Photograph, I wanna touch
Photograph

# 98 AC/DC - YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG 
She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there

'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you -

Shook me all night long

Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
She wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

'Cause the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you -

Shook me all night long

# 99 CHIC - GOOD TIMES 
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again
Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turnin', why hesitate
You silly fool, you can't change your fate
Let's cug the rug, little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates, roller-skates
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
Good times
A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turnin', why hesitate
You silly fool, you can't change your fate
Let's cug the rug, little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates, roller-skates
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times

# 100 BLINK 182 - ALL THE SMALL THINGS 
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on my little windmill
Say it ain't so, I will not go
(Na na na)
Turn the lights off, carry me home
(Na na na)
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
(Na na na)
The night will go on, the night will go on
(Na na na)
My little windmill
