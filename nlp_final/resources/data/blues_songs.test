# 1 Billie Holiday Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone 
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all is my advice
We're parting you'll go your way I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on but I'll make it baby
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Please don't talk about me honey when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all is Jerry's advice
We're parting you'll go your way I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

# 2 Bessie Smith A Good Man Is Hard To Find 
My heart's sad and I am all forlorn my man's treating me mean
I regret the day that I was born and that man of mine I've ever seen
Happiness it never lasts a day my heart is almost breaking while I say
A good man is hard to find you always get the other kind
Just when you think that he is your pal you look for him and find him
Foolinground some other gal
Then you rave you even crave to see him laying in his grave
So if your man is nice take my advice and hug him in the morning kiss
Him every night
Give him plenty loving treat him right
For a good man nowadays is hard to find a good man nowadays is hard to
Find

# 3 Memphis Minnie I Hate To See The Sun Go Down
I hate to see evening sun go down
I hate to see evening sun go down
Cause it makes me think I'm on my last go round
Some people take the blues go jump overboard and drown
Some people take the blues go jump overboard and drown
But when they gets on me I'd rather stayn go sit down
I been to the river looked it up and down
I been to the river looked it up and down
But when my mind never let me to jump overboard and drown
Oh take it away now
Yes I know
Play it mister Charlie
While I'm looking at you
Every time I go across that old muddy pond
Every time I go across that old muddy pond
I think about my baby and come easing on back home
Everybody try to show me how to ease my troubling mind
Everybody try to show me how to ease my troubling mind
When the big boat come along to just jump on in behind

# 5 John Lee Hooker Country Boy
I aingt nothing but a country boy
Drifting from town to town
I aingt nothing but a country boy
Drifting from town to town
Got no place ooh yeah
To call my home
Sometime in travelling
I travel when nights are blue
Sometime my night
My night so dark and blue
But I keep on travelling
No place to lay my worried head
I'm just a country boy
Drifting from town to town
Drifting from town to town
I aingt got no place
To lay my worried head baby
Sometime I lay down on the highway
I cry to take my rest
I hear a freight train howling
I drown my head and run
I'm just a country boy
Drifting from town to town have mercy
Now one night I was travelling
I saw a light in the winter
I was so cold at night
And my clothes were soaking wet
I walked on to the door
I knocked on the door
A little girl come to the door
She said Mister what do you want
I said It's cold outside baby
She looked at me and said
Come on in I wanna talk to you
I got a brother who left home
He was twelve years old
Just like the prodigal son
I know you'd find him

# 6 Mississippi John Hurt Casey Jones

He told his fireman to not to fear
Says All I want my water and my coal
Look out the window see me drive wheel roll
Early one morning came a shower of rain
'Round the curve I seen a passenger train
In the cabin was Casey Jones
He's a noble engineer man but he's dead and gone
Casey's wife she got the news
She was sitting on the bedside she was lacing up her shoes
Said Go away children and hold your breath
You're gonna draw a pension after your daddy's dead
Children children get your hat
Mama Mama what you mean by that
Get your hat put it on your head
Go down in town see if your daddy's dead
Mama mama oh how can it be
My daddy got killed on the old IC
Hush your mouth I said and hold your breath
You're gonna draw a pension after daddy's dead
Casey said before he died
Fixed the blinds so the boys can't ride
If they ride letem ride the rod
Trust they lives in the hands of God
Casey Jones was a brave engineer
He told his fireman to not to fear
Says All I want my water and my coal
Look out the window see me drive wheel roll

# 11 Maria Muldaur Long Hard Climb
Hasn't it been a long hard climb
Everything taking its own sweet time
And hasn't there been some long lonely nights
When you didn't think that anything would turn out right
Woah baby come and lay by me
In the cool cool shade of that old oak tree
You can go oh so high
Painting by to that long way down
You can paint a rainbow in the sky
Just try to keep your both feet on the ground
Woah baby come and lay by me
In the cool cool shade of that old oak tree
Hey can you see that sun outside
Say can you feel it deep inside like a song
Like a long long string
Hasn't it been a long hard climb
Everything taking its own sweet time
And hasn't there been some long lonely nights
When you didn't think that anything would turn out right
Woah baby come and lay by me
In the cool cool shade of that old oak tree
Woah baby come and lay by me
In the cool cool shade of that old oak tree
Woah baby come and lay by me

# 12 Chris Smither Get A Better One 
Lemme tell yabout Linda Lou
She had a big head
She slept with her hat on
She had a big butt too
She kept me whole with a big heart
She went away I fell apart
I'm all alone
Yeah I'm on my own
Lemme tell yabout Betty Jean
She had a filthy mind
She worked at the car wash
But she could not come clean
Long as I live I'm gonna love her to death
She said she'd be back I don't hold my breath
I'm all alone
Yeah I'm on my own
I don't know why
They get a look in their eye
And they leave me
They think I don't know
What's going on
But believe me I know they're gone
Lemme tell yabout Billie Ray
She told me she needed a man
Money's nothing
But that's all she'd say
I couldn't get her to say I do
Now she's gone the money too
I'm all alone
Yeah I'm on my own
I'm gonna get me a better one
One with one name
Who comes when I call her
We'll have a lot of fun
Be glad to see me when I get home
Wag her tail when I bring her bones
I aingt alone
Never on my own
We'll sit together in the evening
We'll stick together
We'll never think about leaving

# 13 Chris Smither Hey Hey Hey
I am not a prophet
I wouldn't be one if you paid me
But it doesn't take a lot to see 
Just where you're headed lately
Pretty soon you're gonna ask me
How come the life you lead
Doesn't make you very happy
Or satisfy your needs
You talk about your needs as though
You know just what they are
When in fact to really know them
Is like travelling to a star
It takes so long you die along the way
So I say hey hey hey
C'mon siddown
Let's talk about illusion
How everything is made of it
No wonder life's confusing
All this stuff we take for granted
So solid to the touch
Is just a concrete indication
That we love ourselves too much
But if we don't love ourselves you say
Who will Whatever for
I say that's a better question
Than the one you asked before
But the answer is still just as far away
So I say hey hey hey
Let go of all of this
Forget about your reason
You can leave it all behind you
You can start another season
All these silly little fictions
Are gonna take you by surprise
When you see them in the daylight
And finally realize
You told them to yourself
Nobody else was listening
You'll be standing broken hearted
Like a disillusioned Christian
With your mouth open but nothing left to say
So just say hey hey hey

# 19 Robert Cray Does It Really Matter
You know it doesn't really matter
That I always seem to forget
Where I put my keys my hat and my coat
We're searching for your sun glasses
And you've lost the remote
Did you forget the heat
'Cause I'm getting chills
Are the lights really going out
Did we forget to pay the bills
Why does it really matter
'Cause when the lights go out it only gets better
When you hold me tight and tell me it's alright
Then the rest doesn't really matter
I guess it doesn't really matter
That we aingt been riding high
And keeping up with the Jones
Never been to Pairs I don't care if we go oh no
We'll get around the world right here at home
Now the car won't start
And the paint is peeling
So the dishes are stacking up
They can wait I've got that feeling
Why does it really matter
We can dim the lights and put on Incomprehensible
Now baby hold me tight and tell me it's alright
Then the rest doesn't really matter
Why does it really matter
'Cause when the lights go out it only gets better

Why does it really matter

And even if I ask you
Darling don't confess
Don't confess
Just let it remain a secret
But darling I love you so
Love you so
No wonder no wonder I wonder
Though I really don't want to know
Though I really don't want to know

# 25 Peetie Wheatstraw Cocktail Man Blues
Good morning people

Good morning people
Just got back from cocktail land
When I find my little woman
Ooo well we gonna raise some cocktail sand
When I got up this morning
Went down in old alley can
I got up this morning
Went down in old alley can
And the womens they was hollering
Hoo wellHere come that little cocktail man'
They cryCocktails for two'
Now that is all it can be
CryingCocktails for two'
Baby that's all it can be
Now if you got plenty of cocktail
Please save atall' for me
I'm a good cocktail monsieur
Well you know I start it all with a feather
Um hm babe said I start it off with a feather
Now won't you come here little mama
Please now let's serve our cocktails together
Well now it aingt no trouble
When I watch your crowd the best I can
I say I aingt no trouble
I will watch your crowd the best I can
But now when it come to missing cocktails
Hoo well here's a little cocktail man
