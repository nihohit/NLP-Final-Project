# 1 Annihilator Murder
Six feet under
No longer alive
This is your destiny
Case I have arrived
I am not a nightmare
I am disease
And I'll bring society
To its' knees
Murder the world
I was born to murder the world
The fools and the innocent
They're all the same
To me I thrive on
Pleasure and pain
It's not war of attrition
I never lose the games
Feel the grand invasion
Feasting in the veins
I was born to murder the world
Your strength devoured
Just wither away
'til the final hour
The battle is won
March to the beat
I am the plague invincible
That you can't defeat
I was born to murder the world

# 2 Annihilator Knight Jumps Queen
a gentleman invites a lady to his castle for a friendly game of chess to his
Surprise she proves to be an excellent opponent with ample experience in this
Field the game drives hard into the night where it finally ends in a draw
However it looks like they're both winners in the end if you know what I mean
This is the first song I'd written may 1991 for the lp crunchy driving
Rhythms provide a great backdrop for the 'theatre-like' vocal performance a fine
Pair of solos I must say
Good evening and welcome to a test of the minds
This match begins as our thoughts begin to grind
I send a pawn towards you a subtle piece of my attack
Pondering the next move I guess you'll never know unless you try it
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
You have made selections a white castle crumbles at your feet
To counter the men in black your moves must all be elite
A bishop takes a rook and this cuts him down to size
This is no tailor-made situation
I guess I have some real competition for once
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
Hours and hours to a stalemate this game has come to a close
Could it end without a climax between to exhausted foes
Night-time's falling on the castle it's bringing in another day
The concentration was impossible I never had a doubt I wouldn't win it from you
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen

# 3 Meduza Touch The Sky
A perpetual fire
Reign of passion my heart is in flames
An eruption of violent fury
Touches me gentle as a breeze
An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behind
My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky
There are no boundaries no limits
When you are riding on the wings of a song
They've always told me to slow down
I have tried but I can't live a lie
An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behind
My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky
An eruption of violent fury
Can't live a lie my heart is in flames
There are no boundaries no limits
When you follow the voices of your soul
An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behind
My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky

# 4 Meduza Hounds Of Hell
See the world the way I do
Through the eyes of a bitter truth
Fear will shoot through your soul
You raise your cup and drink their blood
You've gained the power but you've lost your soul
Oh what have you done
Can you feel their breath
Like ice down your spine
They are here
Hounds of hell sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die
Cast away your chains and run
The battle for your life's began
Don't ever look back
You can hear the hideous cries
They're getting close you know they're near
Oh they'll tear you apart
Can you feel their breath
Like ice down your spine
They are here
Hounds of hell sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die
Hounds of hell sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die

# 5 Cans Silent Cries
How can I take on this mission
That I've been told to do
My hands are tied I am crucified
I'm a stranger in a strange land
So now I'm feeling the pressure
It's boiling up inside
Where hatred only grows stronger
Comes a man a beast a killing machine
And visions that are haunting me
Through my blind eyes I still can see
The mission has to be done
Silent cries the spirit dies
By the hands of the innocent
Before blue skies will fade to black
On a darkened horizon
The clouds are closing in
When skies are fading to black again
Hold your breath I'm ready to attack
So now I'm caught in the action
There's nothing left to do
I fear the end coming nearer
Pull the trigger now the curtain's closed
And all is coming back to me
Through open eyes I cannot see
The mission had to be done
Silent cries the spirit dies
By the hands of the innocent
Before blue skies will fade to black
Silent cries the spirit dies
Wash my hands of the innocent
I close my eyes and say goodbye

# 6 Cans Dreams
When the night comes down
And I'm feeling cold
Shadows are moving around
I've been here before
Where the roads lead to nowhere
Please don't make a sound
Up from the gutter they will rise
With fiery eyes
And when the dungeon's calling
You'll hear my silent cries
They've been chasing my dreams
Running down the boulevard
I never thought I'd see the day
When the night is coming down I pray
I am lost in a maze
Of stolen dreams
Losing track of the time
Nothing here but screams
And the walls coming closer
Crawling down my spine
Temptations lead me far beyond
The other side
I fear the end is coming
There's no place to hide
They've been chasing my dreams
Running down the boulevard
I never thought I'd see the day
What is left of my dreams
In this dusk embracing scene
I never thought I'd live to see
When the night is coming down I pray
They've been chasing my dreams
Running down the boulevard
I never thought I'd see the day
What is left of my dreams
In this dusk embracing scene
I never thought I'd live to see
When the night is coming down I pray

# 7 Cryonic Temple The Story Of The Sword
Four soldiers are riding together as one
Striking the enemies soon they are gone
Live by the sword
Never surrender they will carry on
Soldiers of war they are never alone
Flash of the blade
Riding through the fields
Carry on with steel
We're the ones that will carry on
We will make you see
We're the ones made of steel
We will make you bleed
The sword will tell the story
The sword will tell the tale
The sword will tell the story
The swords of the black knights
Plundering the village then burning it down
The terror of death will it ever be gone
Scream all in vain
One year has now passed and the soldiers are three
But still they are riding and using their steel
Die by the blade
Riding through the fields
Carry on the steel
We're the ones that will carry on
We will make you see
We the ones made off steel
We will make you bleed
The sword will tell the story
The sword will tell the tale
The sword will tell the story
The swords of the black knights

# 8 Cryonic Temple Steel Against Steel
The night begins with an awful sound
The screams of pain in the night
You are the one the only one
To make up this fight
Standing there in the rain
Fighting you are alone
You try to grab your sword and your shield
But there's nothing there
And as he stabs you in your heart
You cry out in despair
Dying there in the rain
Crying you are alone
When the hammer beats the heart you'll know
The swords of metal that fights so strong
It's gonna be steel against steel
When the hammer beats the heart you'll know
Fading there in the rain
Crying you are alone

# 9 At Vance My Bleeding Heart
Now all that is left
Are these broken pieces of my life
And I'm asking myself
Was it all worth it
Were I was wrong
What was my mistake
I gave you all I had to give
But your love was just a fake
Can't you see
What you've done to me
You took all of me
But you didn't answer my call
You never knew me at all
My bleeding heart
Will tell you
All the pain you've caused
You've torn me apart
And my soul is crying
To bring back our love
Maybe you thought
That nothing in this could
Bring me down
But the truth is here for you
Cause my heart's not made of stone
I'm not the man
That I used to be
You taught me
What sadness means to me
What you see
Is what you've done to me
You just took my heart away
But I couldn't make you see
I could not make you stay 

# 10 At Vance Falling
Running on the edge
Taken one by one
Forces of ave but the battle's just begun
Be numb and ready
With an anger to kill
Taken all your chances
Sharpening your skills
One man to another
Kill eye to eye
You don't have to bother
Telling them goodbye
View to a kill
Using all your skills
Face your enemy
Trade our love against your
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
There I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees and pray
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
Just give me another chance
Please come tell me to leave
Losing your religion
Throw away your fears
Tear away your sorrow
There'll be no more tears
Daring that you struggle
But you kill to survive
Hearing all your troubles
To protect your life
No one will be there
To care about your thoughts
Nothing that you dare
To take away the odds
One man to another
Kill and survive
Face your enemy
Trade our love against your
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
Oh why don't you take my pain away
I can't take it no more
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
I can take whatever you are saying
Just soul kept telling me lies
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
Words are easy to say on and on
But so hard to understand
Falling
Falling
Calling your name
Now that you tore me apart
Don't keep telling me lies

# 11 Place Of Skulls The Watchers
Born unto a place
Carried there from a point in space
Behind a distant sun
Shrieking winds and shifting sands they hide
Twist the golden strands
And in the chalice formed this creature man
Unto his daughters born
The giant's roam and their eyes they shine
The years they fled
But the tail survived the skin they shed
Line of blood alive
The words are few and you know they thrive

# 12 Place Of Skulls The Monster
Their fires are burning
Our ships come ashore
To discover what's already known
And our greed will cost them more
We take what's not our own
Once denied blood flows
And let the monster grow
Their homes we took as our own
And fly our flag in their place
The riches of the land we acquired
Are rivers flowing with disgrace
White man shameful woes
Our independence won
The monster took their soul
We wallow in desire
Like pigs in a mire
No rest for the wicked
Like sons of Bitches
Well I'm not too proud
To talk down
To what's done and said
By the monster we bred
Taken what's not our own
And deny blood had flown
Still the monster grows

# 13 Place Of Skulls The Maker
Foundations of time from the first Earth age
You breathed life into each and every soul
Before the child conceived the plan was secure
A life no law of man can claim or hold
We expose our pride in what we perceive as wise
And take the new life into our own hands
Without regard for the blessed new heartbeat
The machine we created cuts the silver strand
We won't be distracted by the same life we hold to
With our goals and desires we strive to achieve
In our self-proclaimed right for power over life
We now find more value in the trees
In the end our human will won't be done
Though through time we deceive ourselves to believe
And the blood that we spilled the dreams that we killed
In those fractured wombs we'll one day grieve

# 14 Down Lies I Don't Know What They Say But
Sometimes I feel like a man that has to broken hands
All of this thrown at me sinking me neck deep in sand
They can't kill me no more I don't know what they say but it's lies
Underneath all this they should see the man that I am
All of my life I've been tried and then persecuted
They can't kill me no more I don't know what to say cause it's lies
Undenied cold shackles inches from the knife
I defy what's mine shall be but nothing stance
The time not surprised it's the same to sleep as it is to rise
Death or life Look deeply into my eyes
Fire on fire way to be and get a fucking ride
Some desire a fuck you soars through the sky lies

# 15 Candlemass Bearer Of Pain
Once a year the white robes go on a quest
In search of a virgin a child of innocence
Born of Apollon divine is the heritage
Chosen by foe to accomplish a holy task
Bearer of pain Bearer of pain
Lighten the burdens of woe
Bearer of pain Bearer of pain
Heal the wounds of the city
I bear your weight upon my shoulders
I bleed for you and pray
I hear your moaning in my mind
I comfort night and day
From my tower to your foundations
My soul reaches through your walls
Market square of guarded bastions
I answer to your calls
The tears of the city wiped away by summer breeze
The pain is lightened by sweet sweet dreams
The cries of despair are silenced with a lullaby
Sleep my child I'm with you we are one
Bearer of pain
Now a year her chamber is opened again
Led by servants the old one is barely sane
Marked by her burdens the guardian can finally rest
Replaced by another carrying on the continuing test

# 16 Candlemass Clearsight
We sat the sails in July
Knew too well it was final goodbye
At the helm there I stood
Like a tree awaiting the flood
Over the sea and under the stars
We searched the shores both near and so far
Crossed the last line the rim of the world
To find reality life death and birth
Clearsight Fearflight The tears light
Cleartsight Sheer night Near blight
Clearsight Clersight Clearsight
Didn't know what to find
There was no water we could not return
Sailed the deserts of the seas
Four years human debris
Over the sea and under the stars
We searched the shores both near and so far
Crossed the last line the rim of the world
To find reality life death and birth
Clearsight Fearflight The tears light
Cleartsight Sheer night Near blight
Clearsight Clersight Clearsight
We fled the shallow the modern decline
The ship of fools a cursed bark of pine
 compass dead as sea and sky met
We reached the end at the cliffs of regret
HMS Clearsight ghost of the sea
Drifting the oceans forever unfree
In to the storms the rain and the mist
We still sail the dreams from the deepers grave there
Is
Clearsight Fearflight The tears light
Cleartsight Sheer night Near blight
Clearsight Clersight Clearsight
Twilight Twilight Twilight

# 17 Count Raven Masters Of All Evil
There is only one truth around us today
I tell you what is gonna come it ain't no fairy tale
There is a group of families that hold our destiny
In pact with the darkest one they rule the economy
The metropolitan 400 they are called
But in the end the 7 families rule them all
Those families of evil set all presidents to rule
But they are all just puppets the masters' favourite tools
The masters of all companies you can call them too
So much money it seems with it they don't know what to do
For instance they financed the entire world war two
Or did you think that Hitler all alone could pull it through
But that occurance it is a story of it's own
An attempt to get the darkest one much earlier on his throne
And the war against the jews it's so very clear
Without them on this earth the proof of God wouldn't be here
Would it 
You're truly the masters of evil
Abomination the ultimate sin
Destroyers of earth and the father's foundation
You'll burn in hell 'cause it's your dream
A thousand years of crying
All thos fears and denyings
The 7 families are here
The 7 years are near
Marx called them das Kapital we say democracy
God call them the devil so many names it's hard to see
Those sick perverted assholes must achieve their goal
To lose this war with Satan and thrash all human souls
Global destruction: their number one game
Or is the hole in the sky a joke of the insane
So let them have your money just don't let them have your soul
Live free and easy and remember what I told but you feel

# 18 Count Raven Angel Of Death
So sorry it got out of hand
Sometimes it happens You understand
The prisoners broke free inside of them was our experiment
Like LSD to go public it was never meant
Now we must immediately close the file
All accusations the usual way we must deny
The shadow minds gathered around the Pentagram
They always fight a war on our planet grand
Angel of death has come this way & to stay
Using his forces & it's resources to spread the decay
The knowledge of the facts are kept in the dark
A disease You can't see still it's in Your body & heart
Panic buttons are pushed around the world
There's no solution still they pretend like they never heard
There is no safe sex & condoms won't save You
Tell me brothers & sisters what are You going to do
Now the world is entering a sad state
We see no difference between true love & hate
Angel of death has come this way & to stay
Using his forces & it's resources to spread the decay
Children of love arise
Now's the time to use all understanding
Children of God arise
Now You've got to move faster than lightning
To help these people out all minds are set
We pay no attention to those who haven't caught it yet
This is what really makes me ill
To prevent it to go further it seems to be no will
There's only one way to go right now
You don't like it but listen anyhow
Give those people a country help them build it well
Work this out or we will face global hell
Angel of death has come this way & to stay
Using his forces & it's resources to spread the decay

# 19 Count Raven Magic Is
The magic is a foot it is a hand
It controls the sea the air and the land
Created by love cos you are grand
It's up to you to understand
The wind it started blowing
It is the wind of time
It screams and it whispers
Listen to me while still can
Long ago someone created the earth
Then left and since then never heard
But the magic it has never ceased
It's inside you waiting to be released
A small part of your brain you're using
What do you think the rest is for
Use your heart and wake your senses
And terrible forces will come to your door
You can never remove all powers and tear down mountains
You can end starvation and heal the blind
Or change the universe direction
And the easy part raise the dead
This is my message right on to you
No matter where you live or what you do
Leave this world and follow your heart
And we will never be apart

# 20 Darzamat From The Earth To The Stars
Foul weather behind my window
Fatigue on my eyes
I'm so much afraid of this world
That I thought I would do it now
I lay down upon the clouds of pleasure
And sailed through the sea of immensity
Dancing winds were pushing my foggy chariot
And rain was washing away
Remains of daily thoughts from me
In a dream I meditated
And stagnant I sail from the earth to the stars
From the earth to the stars
For there the cold silence washes me
In a moment o the highest illumination
Takes me away beyond reach
Of all the evil hands

# 21 Darzamat Into The Abyss Of Forgotten Woods
When a forest dies and hearts are asleep
With unforeseeing fascination
I was there and they were silent
I screamed but they were silent
The trees standing proudly in their white dresses
Watching me from the distance
Nobody and nothing was able to make them
Speak to me and forgive me
One night I met a tree
Tired and bleeding
I sit near by I'm listening to her cry
Pain so deadly embraced me
And I was united with my thought and spirit
She looked at me in a mournful rapture
She gave me the sign
To carry on with my journey

# 22 Deinonychus A Throne On My Long - Awaited Desires
The search for so many centuries has become
A throne on my long awaited desires that made
Me strong
Through the years of suffering I became one of
The black
All those who tried to stop me never came back
The souls of defenceless beauties the ones
Who pleaded
I carved their flesh drank their blood I am
God
A throne on my long awaited desires
The flame I held high heaven's cry
Now the time has come to reveal
The real God the real prophet
In my darkest time
God prepare to meet me: to the death
After the glorious battle of unholiness
The throne was mine
I look to the angels the unblessed
As I crowned myself
I held up high the blaze of eternal doom
Looking into the eyes of the dyig angel
I said I am God
A throne on my long awaited desires
Forever I will rule

# 23 Deinonychus Here Lies My Kingdom
Phantasmagoric hill of sadness
Beyond the toxic black clouds
A magnificent castle in flamboyant style
A monstrous mass of of ashlar and ice
With splendid gigantic aedicules
Framed with phallic columns and
Mysterious blind arcading with
Misericordian decorated frescoes
A sanctuary for ceremonial unholyness
An invitation to the realm of darkness
I am alone in my dark castle
Standing in the dep catacombs
Searching for new inspiration amongst
This cryptic sanctuary of meditation
The gathering place of raddled bats
Watching through the rose-window feeling
The presence of a menacing air possessing
A voluptuous face enters the black chamber
The tenebrous architectural rules of
Decoration
It's in the end of ancient time of Saltire
Turning back to the perpendicular tabernacle
For celebration with an unblessed sacrament
The deep atmosphere is as ever nightmarish
The dreams are beginning in the asembly of
Coven members the essence of my own mind
The hatred proceeding into the ambulatory
Solitude in castle of horrors
Solitude under the trefoils
A mysanthropic life in a mysanthropic silence

# 24 Deinonychus Inspiring Vulnerable Thought 
Inspired by your curves I reached for my scalpel Searching for any light to
Expose your silhouette Your tears could never cease your fear towards me Be it
As it is I'll just perforate your flesh In my museum I've never been so
Enthralled like this before Absent-minded that I am it made me do all this
The bloodstains born to be a fantastic memorabilia Life explodes in my face
But you wouldn't hear Your picture leaves my imagination another solitary day
Welcomes me In the company of dawn I'll be in therapy Send me a postcard This
Is destiny

# 25 Deinonychus Tears Will Flow
So empty inside like a life that ends
A sun that goes down never shines again
Heart ripped out stone cold hole left
Sleeping forever the only choice i have
No more dreams all faith is lost forever
More
The pain in my soul seems so endless
Waiting for everlasting salvation
All is gone
See the leaves come down so begins the end
Look at the sky-shine with the wintermoon
Frost has set in and all feels so cold
Depression inside reaches the highest
I am going to lay down and rest Darkness
