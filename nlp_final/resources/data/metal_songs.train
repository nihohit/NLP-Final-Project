# 2 PANTERA - FUCKING HOSTILE
Almost every day 
I see the same face 
On broken picture tube 
It fits the attitude 
If you could see yourself 
You put you on a shelf 
Your verbal masturbate 
Promise to nauseate 
Today Ill play the part of non-parent 
Not make a hundred rules 
For you to know about yourself 
Not lie and make you believe 
Whats evil is making love 
and making friends 
and meeting God youre own way 
The right way 
To see 
To bleed 
Cannot be taught 
In turn 
Youre making us 
Ohhhh Fucking hostile 
We stand alone 
The truth in right and wrong 
The boundaries of the law 
You seem to miss the point 
Arresting for a joint 
You seem to wonder why 
Hundreds of people die 
Youre writing tickets man 
My mom got jumped  they ran 
Now Ill play a public servant 
To serve and protect 
By the law and the state 
Id bust the punks 
That rape steal and murder 
And leave you be 
If you crossed me 
Id shake your hand like a man 
Not a god 
Come meet your maker boy 
Some things you cant enjoy 
Because of heaven hell 
A fucking wives tale 
They put it in your head 
Then put you in your bed 
Hes watching say your prayers 
Cause God is everywhere 
Now Ill play a man learning priesthood 
Whos about to take the ultimate test in life 
Id question things because I am human 
And call NO ONE my father whos no closer than a stranger 
I wont listen 
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
Youre making us
Fucking fucking fucking
FUCKING HOSTILE

# 4 Annihilator Brain Dance
we had a great time doing this one! mike's untouchable drumming, my toughest
Guitar work yet and wayne's 'cheesy' violin playing are just three of the
Ingredients that went into making this an annihilator classic. oh yeah, the
More time you hear this, the more you'll hear. thanks to the many, many great
People we've met in the last few years and may you all be healthy and happy.
This recording is dedicated to the memory of ida smith.'

I dropped out of the rat race
I just needed a break from it all
And now I live in the country
With the birds and the bees and these bright white walls
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine
They're so polite and they dress so fine
Sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
I get to play in the grass 'till I'm done
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance
I'd like to call myself an artist
My toe paintings are just the best
But when my feet get tired
I lose the crayon and get some rest
I've got a feeling there's a fish in the floor
I'd better squish it or he'll swim out the door
Sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
I see my fish and I have to run
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance
Rubber shoes, a dirty sock
Plastic toes and it's my pet rock
And this song is very silly and it makes no sense at all because it's weird
Out of the pan and into the fire and back in the pan again
He jumped out of the frying pan, into the fire and he's back again
He jumped, what? , yes he's jumped and he's flying through the air
He jumped out of the frying pan, into the fire and he's back again
Let me introduce you to a friend of mine
She's been here for quite some time
Sometimes we go out for a walk in the sun
To walk with alice is always fun
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance

# 5 Annihilator Fiasco
You take time to cut me down
You're a fool, you're the talk of the town
So jealous, can't you see
It's your own insecurity
Your life is a mess
Slightly obsessed
Are you a paranoid schizo ?
What a fiasco
Looking for scandal, you're under the gun
Cause' I'm having so much fun
They say you're missing a screw
This laugh is just for you, HA!
I don't hold any grudges
I'm such a nice guy
Forgive and forget or better yet
Goodbye

# 6 Body Count I Used To Love Her
I loved her with my heart and soul,
Gave her everything diamonds and gold.
She stabbed me in the back, fucked my friends,
Partied in my house, bitch wrecked my benz.
I used to love her
She did me wrong, now she's gone.
I trusted her with cash and jewels,
She laughed in my face, called me a fool.
The love I gave to her was in vain.
Now I think it's time to return the pain.
I came home one night, she was in my bed
With my best friend giving him head.
What really pissed me off about this shit,
The bitch had never even sucked my dick.

# 11 Badlands Hard Drive
Tearing down the highway lines
It's a fever that I know
Tonight my burning bridges light the skies
The engine screams for murder
And tonight we're gonna bleed
Pushin' the limit through
On a red light rocket ride
The wheel's on fire, but it's alright, alright
They're gonna burn for me tonight
Hard driver, ridin' alone
`Cause there's no lookin' back
And you're never comin' home
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all, hard driver
Turn the ship into the wind
Let the engines roar
Curse the gods and let the metal cry
The eyes of total madness
Are the windows to the soul
You'd be a fool to stop on the edge of lost control
The wheel's on fire
But it's alright, alright
They're gonna burn for me tonight
Hard driver, ridin' alone
`Cause there's no lookin' back
And you're never comin' home
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all, hard driver
Ohh
Ohh
Hard driver, ridin' alone
`Cause there's no lookin' back
And you're never comin' home, yeah, yeah
Hard driver, you're on your own
Give it all hard driver
Give it all hard driver
And there's not looking back
`Cause you're never coming home

# 12 Badlands Rumblin' Train
Just a poor boy
Scratch my back on a razor's edge
This razor's edge I call my home
Keep my thoughts inside myself
Down where they're born and bled
I'll probably die by the fire I breathe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said
In my mind this crazy boy is a runaway train
No one's gonna steal my soul
I'll bite the bullet no more
In my heart this crazy boy is a rumblin' train
Look out babe `cause here I come
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rumblin' train, train
Hmm
The devil's river's runnin' wild in my veins
It kills my mind but feeds my soul
Every night a dirty lady in a different bed
I keep on playin' those hard on games
But I got more in my head
In my mind this crazy boy is a runaway train
No one's gonna steal my soul
I'll bite the bullet no more
In my heart this crazy boy is a rumblin' train
Look out babe `cause here I come
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rumblin' train
Rumblin' bad boy, bad boy on down
Rumblin' train
Rumblin' train, train, train, train, train

# 13 Badlands Loser At The Bar
See us gather round' the bar on friday and saturday night
Trendy clubs we all avoid, every weekend that same old sight
Of us drinking our beers, talking about nothing all night long
And when it's closing time I realise there's something wrong
With me sitting here every weekend wasting precious money & time
And after I have finished some drinks I ain't feeling so fine
Because all my worries & frustrations are taking suddenly hold of me
And when I go to sleep that night a loser's life I clearly see
I'm a loser at the bar
Drunken man philosophies are passing by all night
And I guess they're based on personal frustrations, and that ain't right
But it's human to act this way when you have a sorry life
Which is led by constant failure, sheer misery and strife
When I look back on the things I've said and done right in the past
I called everyone a fool while the only fool was me,
The curtain is falling now so fast
Is there a reason why
I hated everything & everyone, oh I ran So far away from reality
Because I didn't want to be like them
But who's the fool right now
I guess it's me...

# 14 Doro Burn It Up
A heartbeat like thunder
Burning down under
Ready to fly into the great sky
When the flames getting higher
You're feeling the fire
You know it's our turn
We're ready to burn
Burn it up
Bird of fire
Come on and set this place on fire
Burn it up
It will take you higher
Feel the heat and feel the fire
A body of iron
Hits harder then lightning
He's got a sharp sense
That's his best defense
He's a natural born leader
Fast as a cheetah
He's ready to win
Come on let's begin

# 15 Doro Burning The Witches 
When the day is over
The devil is near
The people who know it
Are full of fear
When the devil is coming
A virgin will die
A soldier of the darkness
Will take her life
The demon takes the body
Of the bloodless gal
Outside she's looking pretty
Inside a beast of hell
That's what you are callin'
A hellcat or a witch
And only if she's burning
The demon will die
Burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The demon dies by fire
The witches are hunting
Your soul and your blood
And if you can't escape
They take all that you've got
A soul of the virgin
Can find no peace
Till the fire is killing
The witch - they can be free
Burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries by fire!
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning...

# 16 Doro Enough For You
Every time you call
You can't imagine what it's like
I'm getting chills
I hear your voice each time
And every time we talk
I get shivers down my spine
I can't deny
You're always on my mind
I never had this feeling
Never so strong before
With every day I want you more
I can't stop believing
I can't stop dreaming
Oh God I wish I would know
What can take me into your heart
What can I do
Would you help me from fulling apart
Is my love enough for you?! Enough for your
Everywhere I go
I wish you would pass me by
I keep on waiting for you anytime
And every night I pray
You would think of me sometimes
Hope I could move your heart
Your soul your mind...
Would it really matter
If I knew you better
Would you know which way to go
I can't stop believing
I can't stop dreaming
It's you or no one in this world!
What can take me into your heart
What can I do
Would you help me from falling apart
Is my love enough for you, enough for you
I never had this feeling
Never so strong before
With every day I want you more
I can't stop believing
I can't stop dreaming
Oh God, I wish I would know 

# 17 Lillian Axe Inside Out
You're taking our words
You turn them inside out
You're stealing our words
For something to write about
It's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts all upside down
But it's fallacy
It's time you hear from me, yeah
We're gonna turn you - inside out
You'll twist and turn - inside out
It's time you learn - inside out
Fear for your integrity
You can't hear
What we're trying to say
We're not marionettes
It's our turn to play
Sitting on your throne of greed
Trying to take our thoughts away, away
Stand up for the cause
Cause we're all here to stay, yeah
Inside out, inside out
Now it's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts around, around, around
But it's fallacy
It's time you hear from me
We're gonna turn you - inside out
Turn you around - inside out
It ain't like it sounds - inside out
I'm the one who speaks for me
We're gonna turn you - inside out
You'll twist and turn - inside out
That is why I sing this song
I know I'm right and you are wrong 

# 18 Lillian Axe Psychoschizophrenia
Hey brother, can you spare some time?
It seems I've lost my mind
I'm one strange personality.
Have I gone crazy?
Yeah, Please take me somewhere new.
I don't associate with people, you see,
Maybe that's what's troubling me,
I feel rebellion's overdue,
So chain me up now,
You'll get what's coming to you
Hey, I'm Psychoschizophrenia
Thunderstorms evolving inside of me,
Straight jacket quick and swallow the key,
My sanity lives on the edge
But I'm so happy,
I'm going away,
Hey, I'm Psychoschizophrenia
Hey, I'm Psychoschizophrenia
It's all in your mind, it's all in my mind.

# 19 Lillian Axe The Needle And Your Pain
Feel like I'm loosin' again
Slipping away is the faith I used to cling to
Life seems too strange to be real
Watching you take it all in stride
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
One for you
Time has no mind for regret
Watching you bite on the bullet you were born with
How do you sit there at ease
While something inside steals your peace
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
One for you
No one can convince me that there's method to this madness
As I watch you fade
The hours tick away
With the courage of a lion
And the stead-fast heart of gold
You gave me strength while the flames of my hope
Burn so cold
Feeling the heat once again
Handed us hope as you rose up from the ashes
Gone is the pain so be free
Now in your name we can see
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
One for you

# 20 Acid Bath Diab Soule
Summer feels like death
Godless we run
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my heart the song plays on
The Insects Requiem
I understand
And don't care
'Cause the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
From out here
From out here
From out here

# 21 Acid Bath New Corpse
The pagan flames burn through the night
Everything's mine
Blackness my whore I bleed the light
Everything's mine
I know my time is coming soon
Everything's mine
Miles of bone lay on the ground
It's all mine
In remembrance of warmth would you shit on me?
I am the new corpse paling beneath the shade tree
You can't give me what I need
Picking at scabs with ambition to bleed
You're mine
The war machine moves forward lifeless
Everything's mine
We feed larvae with the blood of our martyrs
Everything's mine
We burn the flames of the funeral carnival
Everything's mine
I am death waking up in a coffin
It's all mine
I eat the eyes and pray to see
The emptiness inside of me
I eat the brain and pray to know
Anarchy of fallen angels
I want to be the enemy
The hero is dead
I put the newest hole in his head
I want to be the enemy
The hero is dead
I put the newest hole in his head
Bleed for me, we were born dead
I want to be the enemy
The hero is dead
I put the newest hole in his head
I want to be the enemy
The hero is dead
I put the newest hole in his head
Bleed for me, we were born dead,
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Falling chunks of flesh
Ejaculating sickness
Everything's mine
Shit lord, scum God swallow me whole
Everything's mine
I am death waking up in a coffin
Everything's mine
Your new corpse is beauty
Dying on the inside
It's all mine...
Mine.

# 22 Acid Bath Tranquilized
Sedated and lazy, cold skies full of blue
The sun burns forever, it reminds me of you
On your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
I will make it through even without you
My sky will be blue, I live tranquilized
Slow motion, liquid universe I'm feeling nowhere
It don't matter where we're goin' 'cause I already been there
On your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
They're dying of rabies, eating their babies
In fields of dead daisies, I live tranquilized
I live... I live... I live... I live...
I live... I live... I live... I live...
Tranquilized
I'm numb and unfeeling
So I just burn and stare at the ceiling
I'm here but so far away
I see your mouth movin' but can't hear what you say
And I don't think I give a fuck anyway

# 23 Fury In The Slaughterhouse Bring Me Home
There is this emptyness I carry around with me
Just like a hole that you will never see
I wander in the sun but it's cold inside of me
I'm a monkey in the zoo but someone cut my tree
Hey God if you are really up there and I am not alone
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home
My oversized bedroom appears so small without you
I've tried it all from pills to gin but haven't found the clue
It's like someone has locked the door so I can't get through
To where the emptyness is wiped away by you
Hey God if you are really up there and I am not alone
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home

# 23 Fury In The Slaughterhouse Falling Apart
Falling apart ... right from the start
Always had harder questions
For all these flimsy answers
Falling from grace ... locked away in outer space
Saving deep emotions never touched upon
Falling apart
Falling apart
Falling apart ... right before the start
Broken heart....fallout
Lost in dirt and dust
Tried to escape vanity and hate
not the one providing answers
Can barely help myself
Falling apart
Falling apart
Falling apart

# 24 Fury In The Slaughterhouse Hell Gets You Nowhere
Stood by the roadside late at night
Hell came along and offered me a ride
I thought about it the I said no
I asked my suitcase and my suitcase said let's go
And the bass said
Hell gets you nowhere
That I swear
Went to church sunday without my mum
Laughed about my neighbour who sat on my chewinggum
He said the lord would punish me
And hells the right place for me to be

# 25 Lollipop Lust Kill Black All Over 
I haven't slept in weeks; not one single wink
Every moments like an eternity
Clocks, louder every chime; speaks to me in rhyme
Tell me, is it time to let my feelings go?
Black
Black all over
Black all over
Life is nothing but a dream to me
Black all over
Black all over
Tragedy my reality
Ive lost touch with my thoughts; twisting my life pulls
Pushing me farther away
Locked in I can't get out; free to run about
Tell me, is it time to let my feelings go?
Black
Black all over
Black all over
Life is nothing but a dream to me
Black all over
Black all over
Tragedy my reality
Do you beleive you can be the one, be the one
Shining brightly underneath a dark deadened sun?
All we are
Are single numbers
Its time to count
The single numbers
My time has come and gone; run, everybody run
This game is over and Im done; run, everybody run
My time has come, it's time...
Everybody run
Black
Black all over
Black all over
Life is nothing but a dream to me
Black all over
Black all over
Tragedy my reality

# 26 Lollipop Lust Kill Perfect Women
You know I like it so you play the game
You play it so well but it's not the same
Just look behind my eyes to see my need
The cutting thoughts beneath will make you bleed
You look so pretty but this will not do
You still have color there's still life in you
Your body's still, but your skin is warm
This mere illusion will not turn me on
I want to feel you while you are in your death bed
You will taste my kiss as your eyes grow cold and dead
Soft whispers of a dead girl, twisting in my mind
Gently screaming kill my thoughts, soon it will be time
You know I like it so you humor me
I really like this but my eyes still see
A cold look on your face where life remains
Sometimes I wish this was not just not a game
You look so pretty but this will not do
You still have color there's still life in you
Your body's still, but your skin is warm
This mere illusion will not turn me on
I want to feel you while you are in your death bed
You will taste my kiss as your eyes grow cold and dead
Soft whispers of a dead girl, twisting in my mind
Gently screaming kill my thoughts, soon it will be time
Soft whispers of a dead girl, twisting in my mind
Gently screaming kill my thoughts, soon it will be time
You know I like so you play the game
You play it so well but it's not the same
I need to feel you cold and dead
To get these monsters from my head
You know that death becomes you
Your bloody body lying on my bed
You know that death becomes you
Silence the screams and voices in my head
You know that death becomes you
And all my fantasies will come alive
You know that death becomes you
The perfect woman in my mind's eye
You know that death becomes you

# 31 Dokken Standing In The Shadows
He was a desparate man
They couldn't understand
He wanted more from life
It was his one device
Yeah, he fell tried and hung
When the lights were low
Yeah it was in his eyes
And it was no surprise
Through the streets at night
He's smiling like no other
As he paid again
Look to find another
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows
He was looking
Looking for a place to hide
He felt this way before
And knew he wanted more
He knew the dawn would come
And he'd be on the run
But still they drove him on
Like a loaded gun
His time was running out
And he realized that he'd been here before
Like a scream in the night
For his crime they showed no pity
Even though they'd done the same
It's the way of life in the city
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows
He was looking
Looking for a place to hide
Lock your doors
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
He was standing in the shadows
Looking
Looking for a place
Standing in the shadows
He was standing in the shadows
Watching the world
Standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows
He was standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows

# 32 Dokken When Some Nights
Take me back, to a time I remember well
It's a fact, when you're near
You know we could stop the world
If I'm wrong, then all right
You know it doesn't matter now
In my heart, you are mine
You know we're gonna make it somehow
Say it's not over yet
I can be anything, just for you I can make it right
Fortunes told in love's hearts, it doesn't have to keep us apart
I'm a soldier of fortune, fighting for a means to an end
If there's love in your eyes, it's only gonna take one night
Yeah, say it's not over yet, and remember...
When some nights you are lonely
You just call out my name
I will make you mine only
Make you mine only again
On the wings of a tear
You know we could ride the storm
Like desire, I was born
To give you everything and more
If you're a soldier of fortune
Fighting for a means to an end
If there's love in your eyes
It's plainer than the world we share
Yeah, say it's not over yet, and remember....
When some nights you are lonely
You just call out my name
And I'll make you mine only
And you will never be lonely
When some nights you are lonely
You just call out my name
I will make you mine only again
Make you mine only again
Hold on to what you have
And not what you think is yours
Too many people stand there
Blinded by the light. They don't see.
Take me back to a time I remember well
It's a fact, when you're near
You know we could stop the world
So remember...

The shootin's over
The smoke is clear
Another notch in my gun
Another round of ammunition
Before the damage is done
She wanted this
I gave her that
She said she will

She felt no pain
When I started moving in for the kill
Cuz I've got bullets
Bullets to spare
I've got bullets- bullets to spare

My hand is steady
Tonight I'm ready for fun
I got my finger
It's on the trigger
Another night on the run

Tried so hard, to make you see.
But I couldn't find the words.
Now the tears, they fall like rain,
I'm alone again without you.
Alone again without you.
Alone again without you.
I said, �stay.� But you turned away
Tried to say it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels
I'm alone again.
Tried so hard, to make you see.
But I couldn't find the words.
Now the tears, they fall like rain,
I'm alone again without you.

I'm alone again without you.
Alone again without you.
Alone again without you.
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again

# 37 Ratt So Good, So Fine
Get these big wheels turnin
Within those white lines
Wondering do you still feel at home
It's been an awful long long time
I ain't been caught smokin
Don't tell lies
Feel the rhythm in the cars
Rollin across the state line
Do you think we could have a little
There's no more todays
Don't you think we should have a little faith
So much more
It's so good, so good
It's so fine, so fine
It's so good, so good
And it's all mine, so fine
Thanks so much for the talkin
Glad to be obliged
Did you feel the cross did ya feel the loss
When your runnin at the line
I keep your heart hangin
Read between the lines
Until the day
Water turns to wine
Do you think we could have a little
There's no more todays
Don't you think we should have a little faith
So much more
It's so good, so good
It's so fine, so fine
It's so good, so good
And it's all mine, so fine
It's so good, so good
It's so fine, so fine
It's so good, so good
And it's all mine, so fine
Your 9 to 5 is such a crime
Feel the rhythm in the cars
Rollin across the state line
Gimme one more just like today,
It's so good
Do you think we could have a little
There's no more todays
Don't you think we should have a little faith
So much more
It's so good, so good
It's so fine, so fine
It's so good, so good
And it's all mine, so fine
It's so good, so good
It's so fine, so fine

# 38 Motorhead Dr. Love
Working the room with her cat clothes on,
Messing up my mind
Mouth just made for kissing
Says a good man's hard to find,
I'm just hangin' standin' there,
Can't believe my eyes,
She looks so fine and she smiles so kind,
Make a strong man cry.
She does me in, and she'll do you too.
She only got to shake it,
And I'm shaking in my shoes
You know she's a natural woman
You know she likes that fine
You know she's a total killer,
And she ain't even trying
I want her so bad I get shivers
If I can't see her enough
She asked me my name, I said "Honey,
My name is Doctor Love"
Sat down by me and I told her
She's like to drive me blind
She smiled like a hungry tiger
Said a hard mans good to find
I just stood there helpless,
Wondering what I should move,
She said "Come on honey, show me your money
Ain't got no time to lose".
She does me in, and she'll do you to
She only has to shake it,
And she shakes me in my shoes.
You know she's a lovely lady
She ain't no easy girl
She make me wanna love her long time
To make her toenails curl.
I want her so bad I get crazy
If she don't love me enough
I want to examine her stamina
'Cos my name is Doctor Love.
She got no human pity
She don't care who she hurts
The face of an evil angel
Says a hard man makes her worse
I want to drive her crazy
Get her in her in between
But she makes it awful hard
If you see what I mean
She does me in, and she'll do you too
She only got to shake it

# 39 Motorhead I'm So Bad, Baby I Don't Care
I make love to mountain lions
Sleep on red-hot branding irons
When I walk the roadway shakes
Bed's a mess of rattlesnakes
Voodoo child, black cat bone
Scratch your back, hear you moan
I get up, you go down, tall building, single bound
War and peace, peace and love, say it if you dare
Iron fist, velvet glove
I'm so bad, baby I don't care
Black-hearted to the bone
Older than The Rolling Stones
Been to heaven, been to hell
Bought the farm, and I won't sell
Give and take, rise and fall, rise up and take it all
Secret love, I won't tell, knock you up and ring your bell
Kiss the whip, eat the gun
Tell me it ain't fair, midnight victim, hit and run
I'm so bad, baby I don't care
I make the blind to see
Shoot 'em full of R and B
I make the lame to walk
Come round and pop your cork
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am
Thought I heard the back door slam
Overkill, walk the line, kill the lights, it's lampshade time
On the road, on the lam, people running scared
I'm everything they say I am, I'm so bad, baby I don't care
And I'm shaking in my shoes
You know she's a classic beauty
She don't want to fight
She like a man who's standing tall
And stood up all right
I want her so bad I get crazy
If she don't call me up
She said, "Honey, do you want me to call you?"
I said "Just call me Doctor Love

# 40 Motorhead Shoot You In The Back
Western movies!
The riders ride, into the night,
Into the West, to see who's gun's the best,
They're all fools, to live by rules,
The rider wearing black,
He's gonna Shoot You In The Back
The horseman turns, the wound that burns,
The awful pain, the crimson rain,
Got realise, before he dies,
The rider wearing black,
You know he's gonna Shoot You In The Back
It's suicide, to live on pride,
You claim you own, your skin your bone,
Your own life, cuts you like a knife,
The rider wearing black,
He's gonna Shoot You In The Back
In the Western movies!

# 41 Steel Prophet Fatal Euphoria
Feel the rush as it tingles, tantalizing my spine
How many more times can my nerve endings explode
Jonesing again for that one last dose
Shove it in my veins until I'm comatose
When I'm gone I can't do anything
The beating of my heart consumes everything
Finding a cure for this never ending quest
I battle with the demon, he cheats me with his test
I have played the fool stuck pins into my eyes
My rage of hate attacked me haunts my soul and dies
Why does it control everything in me
When I'm in control I know wrong from right
But when it's in my blood i can't put up a fight
Feeling weak and powerless I begin to cry
How could I betray myself to my loved ones
Cheat & lie
I kneel before the god that stole my life
I am still alive in here but don't know how to die
Emptiness and tortured awash in misery
My body craves another fix I just wish to die
All the things I've lost and ruined repentance can't buy
When I'm stretched out on a slab no rush forever more
As my mind breaks sweats and my body aches 
Pushed up are the stakes
Will I live to see my mind cleared of slavery 
My weakness cured by bravery

# 42 Steel Prophet Phobia
Ever flowing streams of stubborn morals created to seal the gate
Mankind's biological timebomb, a must see comedy
Limits we place inside slows evolution to a crawl
The beast inside scratches and claws to be free
A cage of solid steel
A lock without a key
Weakened minds wither to dust
Strong words from blistered mouths
Parasites of myths and lies will eat your mind away
The multidimensional universe is gone forevermore
Scavenges your mind for unique patterns you can't conceal
The door to evolution is sealed eternally 

# 43 Steel Prophet To Grasp Eternity
We seek for ways to connect
To a higher supreme source
Those that hunger for knowledge
Set their spiritual course
Just as a mirror points at another
Reflects an unending world
Aeturn divided makes waves of light
That spark and create all life
The never ending questions
Answers beyond our comprehension
That lead mankind to ponder through
The mystery of it's dimension
Time is a circle that measures decay
And points out change is at our hands
Can anything happen would seem to be true
As miracles sometimes do
Waiting for the Chakras to open our psychic doors
Of seven vital centers dormant deep within
The Kundalini will awaken and rise to
Enlighten us as we manifest through polarity
Escape this flesh reality, joining from the beginning
To grasp eternity...eternally
A soul is eternal, a fragment of the divine
As a circle turns on comprehend forever more
Do as thou will as long as it harms no one
Question all that you believe and know yourself
Inside and out
This concept is god!
Molecules are as one
All souls are as one, as psychic forces show
Your pain is mine, I wouldn't have it this way
So do unto others, our souls are as one!
Your pain is mine
I wouldn't have it this way
So do unto others, our souls
Are as one

# 44 Diamond Head Out Of Phase
You never listen in to what they know
They only play the songs you've always known
Can replace the roll of fifty nine
As you are and always were in love that time
You're unsure of the marriage vow
Lived it once, and in it hide you now,
The morning ash the fire of sixty nine
Will remain with you and hope for better times
Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me
Out of phase, out of phase
Finding love, you go to memories
Hold on tight, romantic hearts are near
Going somewhere, is there anywhere
That smiles aloud, a place where all are proud.
Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me
Out of phase, out of phase
Looking around me
You're not the only one
Looking for something old
Looking for something done
Out of phase, out of phase
Out of phase, out of phase
Wo oh oh wo oh oh
Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me
Out of phase, out of phase
Never seeing, never saying who you are
Don't conform to them
You're better as you are,
Out of phase, out of phase.....

# 45 Diamond Head Dust
I've tried believin' even tried cheatin' myself
Of almost everything just to fashion reason out of what
Must have been nothin' at all
Now I can't when exactly I saw through the darkness and into the light
Fantastic as it was it was cool and bright
Like on a steely night of shadows
Still far from home
When I came round
I saw myself on a merry go round
With my heart on the ground
And there I see
The rains coming down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me
But you can set me free
I won't believe ya neither deceive ya when you say we gotta carry on
'Cos I know the dream is over
The one we shared so long...too long
When we could have been getting on just being friends
And not holding on to the past
Which is just sand
I guess we try to belong
'Cos we have to be strong just to get it done
But I was on the ground most of the time
On a merry go round looking up but going down
And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me
Can you see? The rain beat down, rain come down
But what can we do with a thing like you
A heart with a hard on for ignorance
A child of fools where nothing rings true
In a myth that's cruel, where I see the cross
You see the nail, where you see the mytsery I see the failure
And it's bringing me down, I'm just a clown
On a merry go round looking up but going down
And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
A spider fingered vice all sugar and spice
Runnin' down my face feelin' like black rain
Clawin' under my skin and running through my veins
Like a poison I must suck just to change my luck
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Rain beat down...down...rain beat down
Down Down Down Down Down Yeah
Rain beat down...Dream come down

# 46 Diamond Head Waited Too Long
Now I feel I must say goodbye, I wanted you to see
It's not over between you and I, I'm sure you must agree
I gave you time but not enough it seems
I'm saying baby
Waited too long, waited too long for you to see
Waited too long, I've waited too long
Waited too long, waited too long
Waited to long for you to be
Waited too long, waited too long
Ooh baby, I must be moving on
Cos now I know we're not in love
And soon I will be gone
The times that we've had, good and bad
I'm saying baby
Waited too long, waited too long for you to see
Waited too long, I've waited too long
Waited too long, waited too long
Waited to long for you to be
Waited too long, waited too long
I will be moving on, I've waited so long
Soon I will be gone, oh don't you see

# 48 Day Of Contempt Scarred Proof
The army of darkness
Blackened corpse, continuous source
Victims of lost hope, lost will
Flame burned low through fault of mine
Strength left to clutch at the flames
Ive seen the depths of darkness
But there are those whod die before fall
Sooner claimed by blood than evil
By cold steel before your apathetic ways
I have seen the suffering
Scarred proof of battles lost and won
Society struggles on, through race, sex and specieism
Oppresion will divide the weak, unite the strong
The only victims are those who
Who give in.

# 49 Day Of Contempt Nothing Remains
Pain all I feel, nothing remains
Wound will not heal, ever again
Never again
All my life Ive been decieved, never again
Ive buried hope with defeat, nothing remains
Ive been blinded by this life
See nothing but black
I wont forfeit the chance to bring it back
Ill stand up for what I believe
For every second I breathe
I have been doomed by fate
But there's another way
Ive been decieved all my life
I wont turn away, I refuse
I wont accept fate, I refuse to give in

# 50 Exit-13 My Minds Mine
Why should I even bother to acknowledge the pathetic notions of =
Minds without knowledge?
I have been chastised for acting too freely, but individulism for me =
Is the key, see?!?
Why should I style my pattern of life after those who bring about =
Hatred and strife?
I would much rather have a mellow existence of celebration and =
Productive subsistence!
My minds mine!!!
Individuality, creativity, self - mastery...not for you?
Sensability, originality, responsability...not for you?
Stability, free mentalities, global harmony...not for you?
Stupidity, live destructively, "self" is all you see...is this you?
Pathetic apathy, christianity, no mentality...is this you?
Spreading misery, no flexability, lost and lazy...is this you?
So in conclusion, let's ignite a struggle for total transcendence =
From this confining muddle!
It seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom, don't end up =
Like our parents, tranquilized by their stupidity!

# 51 Exit-13 Facilitate The Emancipation Of Your Mummified Mentality
The bulk of society is imprisoned mentally
Caged by ideas we're subjected to continually
Conditioned from birth by entrenched ideologies
Free thinking minds are quickly crushed by
Dark sinister follies
Facilitate the emancipation of your
Mummified mentality
Take your mind beyond the security of
Unchallenged certainty
You must be in complete control of cognition
Break free from the confines of imposed definition
Arduously ascend through states of
Cerebral transcendence
Embrace the uncertainty of mental independence
Facilitate the emancipation of your
Mummified mentality
Continually scrutinize the factors governing
Your own reality
Develop a propensity for thinking intellectually
Reject flawed thoughts that dogmatize your mind
Refine the ability for trusting sensibilities
That flow forth from the love of humankind
Exercise the faculty for pragmatic rationality
As you become aware and comprehend
Search for validity in all thoughts held intrinsically
Refute stupidity clogging up your head
Facilitate the emancipation of your mind!

# 52 Exit-13 Spare The Wrench Surrender The Earth
Development plans slated, wilderness negated.
Green consciousness frustrated, MONKEYWRENCH!
Conservation policy lies, ecotage on the rise.
Logging equipment fouled...surprise, MONKEYWRENCH!
Biological meltdown, our culture puts nature down,
Subversive action now, MONKEYWRENCH!
Pristine forests felled, death for Earth is spelled,
Our protest can't be quelled, MONKEYWRENCH!
"No compromise in defense of Mother Earth!"
Ecosystems erased, serenity displaced,
Is progress taking place? MONKEYWRENCH!
General apathy toward destructive tendencies,
Can't people fucking see the need to MONKEYWRENCH!?!

# 54 Raging Speedhorn Ride With The Devil
Angry
Blood streaming from my eyes
But you will never hide
Decide what's going on
And fuck your hidden pride
Watch me -You will never see me
Rising - And your eyes are open
Nothing - Justice is the pain now
Fuck You - And the devil takes you
Ride with the devil - Ride with me
He'll take your life away - I'll take you away
Lost in your own world - Pay nothing for this ride
You'll never destroy our fear - Exept your soula and then your mind
You're not supposed to be like me
You decide
You sold your soul for order
So he could take it over
The string he pulls inside my head
At last I will discover
True Meaning of our lord
The devil inside my head

# 55 Raging Speedhorn Necrophiliac Glue Sniffer
Broken fingers are justice
Taking baby for rides
You left me so lonely
That's why Im standing here
Ripping my insides out
You see me running and you feel hatred
This is the feeling I get every day
You throw the petrol and the matchstick
You stupid fuck you forgot to light it
I see you hiding in the shadow
With all the fear and twisted pain
I hear you running 'cause your footsteps cry
You only ever talk because it's too late
Slight invasion of death you brought me
You'll never take me away
I used to love you but it's just no fun
I feel it done inside me
Take me away
Far away
Take me away
Far away
And now you hate because you're just a swine
I see you run because you're just a swine
And now I'm hiding because you're just a swine
And now I'm running because you're just a swine (x2)
Take me away
Far away...

# 56 Pain Of Salvation Disco Queen
Tonight I'll fall, looking for something wonderful yet casual
Extraordinarily temporal, and there you are - let's go
You hooked me on the dance floor
So here I am, back for more
You seem experienced, just an inch too keen on getting exposed
Having your face in every magazine
You're far from being unique but you still look pristine
Mundanely exotic, like the french cuisine
My Disco Queen - let's disco...
TWO: A CHEAP SELLOUT DRUG
You're a cheap sellout drug on everyone's lips
Covered every day, done every way, a whole world at your hips
A bar to fit, the beats you take
Another hit and you will break
Undressed in front of me, all glistening ebony
You're still so young, but I will show you vintage 33
I lay you on your back - inviting curves of black
Making little noises as my needle finds your track
My Disco Queen - let's disco
Disco Queen - let's disco...
THREE: A TIGHTER GROOVE
You leave me wanting more, panting on all four
I know there's more to pluck, and so I go for the encore
I am turning you around, to play your other side
A tighter groove, I want it but I tremble, slip and slide
Baby, you're just what I need
You purr when I make you bleed
I pump you till you cry - feel so alive
I crank you up and switch to 45
A screaming climax chord, I give you all I've stored
A moment's silence and you're filled up, yet emptier than before
Oh - that subtle little sound as I am pulling out
A finished dish upon my plate is what it's all about
A square round of greed
You surrendered to the rhytm, spinning around your hole
Disco made you famous but tonigh you tasted soul
I pumped you till you cried - felt so alive
I cranked you up and switched to 45
You are just begging for more
But I unlock the door (tonight I'll fall...)
You're old news now and so I leave you trembling on the floor...
FOUR: MY DISCO QUEEN
My Disco Queen...
My Disco Queen - let's disco...

# 57 Pain Of Salvation In The Flesh
She walks these empty streets alone
Hiding for something they call "home"
Hoping to find some peace of mind
Sometimes we need to walk alone
She is set on running away
Though her mom was yelling she must stay
A wind beaten bird for reasons unheard
Sometimes it is best to run away
So fly away, fly away, fly away
Don't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away
Some wear their bruises on their skin
Others hide their scars deep within
She has a wound close to her womb
Blames herself for letting it in
So fly away, fly away, fly away
Don't be afraid, don't hesitate, fly away
But She's afraid, she's afraid, she's afraid
Anyway
See those eyes, see those eyes, see those eyes
Hate and lies, a fire that slowly dies
But She will fly, she will fly, she will fly
Before it dies
Sometimes the hands that feed
Must feed a mind with a sick need
And the hands that clutch can be
The same hands that touch too much
Eyes that hungrily stare
Read in an access that's not there
While eyes close to hide tears
Or look away in fear
Run away!
Passing the open stores
Hiding her dirty sores
Seeking asylum among freaks and whores
What wouldn't she give to be in a society
Not learning the eyes to be closed but to see
Now she bites the words
"Never"
She kicks the ground
"Never"
Swallows her tears
"Never will I go back"
She hits the walls
"Leave me!"
Scratches herself
"Leave me!"
Begs to all Gods
"Rip me from this sick flesh!"
"I will always be there"
"No!"
She holds her ears
"You know that I love you"
Pretends that she doesn't hear
"We're in this together"
"We share the same skin"
Panic in his voice now
"Free us from sin"
"Tell me that you love me"
This is the end
"I know that you do"
Of her way
Never ever again
Follow me down
"God forgive this hunger"
"Please mommy see"
"Never tell a soul"
"Is it me?"
A child will love it's parents
Will follow them down
She swears to the pavement's heart of stone
That these city lights will be her home
But still as they burn she will return
Back to the adults. . . of her home.

# 58 Pain Of Salvation Softly She Cries
She pours herself another glass of wine.
Tells herself yet another time she's fine.
But earlier today she lost an hour.
A gaping hole just like.
Inside her.
Inside her.
Whenever a plane is passing by.
Or migrating birds fill up the sky.
Something is stirring deep inside.
She doesn't know why but.
Softly she cries.
Softly she cries.
She wears that smile another day in life.
For all we know another perfect wife.
But sometimes she's just gazing into nowhere.
An empty face just like.
She's not there.
She's not there.
Whenever a plane is passing by.
Or migrating birds fill up the sky.
Something is aching deep inside.
She doesn't know why but.
Softly she cries.
Softly she cries.
Somewhere inside her there's a child.
Longing to break away and fly.
But she is just letting life pass by.
Whenever a plane is passing by.
Or migrating birds fill up the sky.
Something is breaking deep inside.
She doesn't know why but.
She starts to cry.
She starts to cry.
Softly she cries.
She starts to cry

# 59 Unleashed I Bring You Death
Once a friend
With open arms

You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death

On you knees
Before me bleed
How's it feel?
To be the one to be deceived
See the life
Now drain away
As you die
Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death

# 62 Red Harvest Fall Of Fate 
New world disorder
Meltdown of the human lap-top
You are born into this world
To protect and serve
Feed the golden vacuum of machinery
Walking puke
Living fake lives
You walking puke
The road map has been drawn for you
Protect the money flow
Secure the power players
The fall of Fate
Esculates into a wall of hate
I reject their fakking ways
I reject every fakking thing
they say M.O.A.B
in the da house
It's coming anyway

# 65 Evereve Fall Into Oblivion
Downward the shores we pass
Clouds bathed in sombre twilight
Dust beneath our dragging feet
The crumbled shapes of your image
Left behind the dream of a time
That is fading away tirelessly
And paralysed we are
The light of old aged stars
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
... And fall into oblivion...
... And fall into oblivion...
When it comes to the dying season
Will you stay right at our side
When we leave this place together
Through the glens of the afterlife
At the shores of the tranquil sea
Waves take the land tirelessly
Take our thoughts away
To the light of old aged stars
Still in my mind
Only among the stars there lies freedom
Only among the stars there is eternity
Only for one short moment our lives do last
Until the memories are wasted away from the shores out of our galaxy
... And fall into oblivion...
... And fall into oblivion...

# 66 Evereve Pilgrimage
These days are burning down
Every death is an end in the race
- no arrival
These lives - just ripples
In the stunning widths of space
- slipping away
This march will never end
Every stop is a death deep within
- deep within
It is a WAR over years and years
It is a WAR...
Passion in every step
Every month is a part of the circle
- no arriving
Counting your mirthfull days
Every year is a march round the wheel
- on and on
And when there is nothing left to light these worlds
I will be right at your side
I will be there in time
In time...
Marching on...
Travel - Arrival
Together we will drown
In the river of your transciency You will see...

# 67 Evereve Tried & Failed
I'm still pretending
I'm still with you
I'm in the eye of the storm
I'm still longing for your taste
Please release me, I'm with you
Dark is the season
Dark is the sky
Burned the bridges one by one
Voices turning in my head
Soon I will break
Because I tried and I failed
There's nothing left I can call my haven
A travesty we create together
We rose and we fell
This pain inside me will last forever
You're still pretending
You're still with me
You're the best friend of mine
Empty bottles on the floor
Please release me, I'm with you
I keep on standing
Keep on pretending
What I used to be - Bring me down
I keep on fighting on and on
Uphold the fallacy - Down to you
I keep on lying, keep on denying
But I feel I can't take it no more - Bring me down
I'm still pretending

# 68 Darkseed Incinerate 
Follow the fire
Follow the sword
Leave only death
And praise the false lord
Hunting the spirits
Chasing the fools
Raging for purity
Anyone to seduce
Chop all the mortals
Steel finds flesh
Shatter their bones
Eye to eye
Rape all their highness
No reaction
Flatten their homes
A lifetime gone by
Tell me will my hate someday perish?
Will the wrath still hunger for this one bliss?
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Only darkness I can see
Flourish the cancer
Deep in their lungs
Unveil the toxic
Genetic expanse
I am the radiance
No one can see
Turn water sour
For always to be
Infiltrate mortals
No reaction
Mutate their bones
Eye to eye
Swim in the bloodstream
Light in the tunnel
Breaking the nodes
A lifetime to day
Tell me will my hate someday perish?
Will the wrath still hunger for this one bliss?
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Only darkness I can see
One day my hate will perish
I'll defeat the seeds of sorrow
No more hungering for this one bliss
Taking off into a bright tomorrow
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate Incinerate Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines forgotten
Lives colourless nights
Only darkness I can see

# 69 Darkseed Dream Recalled On Waking
...and after a many summer dies the swan
It withers slowly in thine arms
All night long amorous anthems sung
It's tears on your cheek, history of the fan
Sweet is the breath of night
With charm of earliest birds
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide
Dying embers, our only light
(scorching away mortality
Till the moon rising in clouded majesty)
But see the many-coloured prime retired to rest
Thy long tongued blood demands supplies
Honour and beauty are but dreams
Big alike with wound and dart
Like fiery dews that melt
The swan's soul into the boughs does glide
Flaming swords forbidden
They banish me from you
Remembrance of a bitter loss
Ruined love, when it's built anew
Grows fairer, more strong, far greater
While glory crowns so many hatreds crest
Waking, thou wert in thy nakedness
...and after a many summer dies the swan

# 70 Darkseed Speak Silence
Lost, misguided minds, feverish dumb
I wonder how your life will end one day
Your soul is caught in a smiling web of sins
You bring the world to it's knees, again and again
Speak silence, the knife is mine
The knife is mine, your emptiness
Devouring life as stars are waning overhead
You celebrate with demons in your home
You put the world to an end, that's why I say:
Speak silence! You're just walking shades
Go away, back into your mental cage
Live silence! Keep your demons locked
In your mouth, and your head, go away
Speak silence!
There's no cure for your disease
Denn Du bist Mensch, and humans never learn
Live silence! I pierce my bloody knife
In your mouth, and your head, in your veins
Speak silence, the knife is mine
Speak silence, silence
Mine, mine, this knife is mine
You walk towards the end
Feel the coldness in your veins
Down, down, now you get down
Your body crumbles
This fiery pulse of sin now stops to beat
This knife is mine, the pain is your's
Your broken dreams complete
This knife is mine, hurting deep
Again and again I say:
The sun has set and I enjoy the void
Without you the silence is so sweet
All living beings are sinking down
The sky is vacant and I smile
Speak silence when I smile
Speak silence in my loneliness

# 71 Green Carnation Under Eternal Stars
Soft rain falls silent down from a black nightsky
Darkness which I have given my lonely life to
Lay around me like a heavy cloud...
Everything is beautiful, like death is beautiful
Sometime I shall wander here in the realm of darkness
With my princess by my side
Dressed in the colours of the night
Like I am dressed in the colours of the night...
Sometime, I shall share this shivering happiness
With one my heart shall choose
Those who in the night dance....
Cold winds of the fall blow from east
Shadows fall over the tower in the distance...
Darkness returns
Grows bigger and more powerful over the nightsky
Under eternal stars
Under the wings of the screaming raven
I enter the embrace of the fogwoods
Passionated by darkness
Longing for the night
I rest alone, as a child of darkness
As a child of fall, as a child of lonliness
Silent I let my soul wander towards the cold light of the moon
Letting the first nightstar guard me....
The eternal dawn lower over the northern landscape
There - under eternal stars...

# 72 Green Carnation The Quiet Offspring
A choice were made and it came clear to me
The quiet offspring fucked it up again
So I was brought up on the sunny side
Got into fake from day one
But I knew better then the rest of them
Don't count the hours, don't count the days
I don't look back in any ways
Never cared for who or what or when or why
Home is where I rest my head
Never cared for who or what or when or why
I carry on when all is said
You said I should have learned by now
A father's son so disobedient
Such a burden I have been for thy
Nothing good enough
I packed my bags and now you wonder why
Don't count the hours, don't count the days
I don't look back in any ways
Never cared for who or what or when or why
Home is where I rest my head
Never cared for who or what or when or why
I carry on when all is said
Never cared for who or what or when or why
Never cared for who or what or when or why
Never cared for who or what or when or why

# 73 Nightwish Feel For You
You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent
I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair
Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves
Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade
Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine
This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you

# 74 Nightwish Long Lost Love
Trees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me
Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me
Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
So aware,
What should be lost is there
I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love

# 75 Nightwish Turn Loose The Mermaids
A kite above a graveyard grey
At the end of the line far far away
A child holding on to the magic of birth and awe
Oh, how beautiful it used to be
Just you and me far beyond the sea
The waters, scarce in motion
Quivering still
At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveler rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes
Good journey, love, time to go
I checked your teeth and warmed your toes
In the horizon I see them coming for you
The mermaid grace, the forever call
Beauty in spyglass on an old man's porch
The mermaids you turned loose brought back your tears
At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveler rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes
At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveler rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes 

# 76 Nightwish The Crow, The Owl And The Dove
Don't give me love, don't give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don't give me love, I've had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
A crow flew to me, kept it's distance
Such a proud creation
I saw it's soul, envied it's pride
But needed nothing it had
An owl came to me, old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned it's ways, envied it's sense
But needed nothing it had
Don't give me love, don't give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don't give me love, I've had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
A dove came to me, had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched it's calm, envied it's love
But needed nothing it had
A swan of white, she came to me
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet
I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Gar tuht river, Get te rheged
Don't give me love, don't give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don't give me love, I've had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead

# 77  IRON MAIDEN - Wasted Years
From the coast of gold across the seven seas
Im travellin on far and wide
But now it seems Im just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do it isnt me but
someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Aint it funny how it is you never miss it til its
gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be til my
dying day
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realise youre living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands I got you on my mind
Cant ease this pain so easily
When you cant find the words to say its hard to
make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my
hands up to the sky
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realise youre living in the golden years
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realise youre living in the golden years

Youre wearing me out
Come on
Reach out
And let somebody into your life
Dont get me wrong

Of making a scene
You need to be loved

Come on
Reach out
And let somebody into your life
Come on
Reach out
And let somebody into your life
Over your head
You just dont seem to understand
One word I say
And you cant live your life
You got so much love
Its burning inside
Come on
Reach out
And let somebody into your life
Come on
Reach out
And let somebody into your life
Reach out
And let somebody into your life

# 79 IRON MAIDEN - Sheriff Of Huddersfield
Life in a city living in LA
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbows a long way from heaven
But thats where he gets his pork pie
Limos and ladies theyre driving him queasy
Rugby and crickets unknown
Baseball and football theyre making him lazy
Your fan club says Rodney come home
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Youre our own Hot Rod on wheels
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire hes yearning but because hes earning
Hell always live in LA
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
Hes winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Youre our own Hot Rod on wheels
Hello let me introduce myself
My name is Rodney Im immensely strong
When I were a lad I could lift up five
Navies on an end of a shovel
The reason I never took martial arts because
I was immensely fearsome and
Id probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it
I was phenomenally strong
Pride and ego my lads pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
But I dont live there anymore
I live in Los Angeles
Its great I think
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
Youll wish youd never been born
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney LA
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Youre our own Hot Rod on wheels

# 80 IRON MAIDEN - Tailgunner
Trace your way back 50 years
To the Glow of Dresden - blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight - yeah
Who shot who and who fired first
Dripping death to whet the blood thirst
No radar lock on - skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
Youre a Tailgunner
Nail that Fokker kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecasts good for War
Cologne and Frankfurt have some more
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunners gone
No more Bombers just one big bomb

# 81 IRON MAIDEN - Holy Smoke
Believe in me - send no money
Died on the cross and that aint funny
But my so called friends are making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke
They choose what they wanna hear - they dont tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as theyre watching you die
Saving your souls by taking your money
Flies round shit bees around honey
Holy Smoke Holy Smoke plenty bad preachers for
The Devil to stoke
Feed em in feet first this is no joke
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records burning books
Holy soldiers Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles just wait a while
Till the TV Queen gets her make up clean
Ive lived in filth Ive lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit youre in
They aint religious but they aint no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac it was cool
Two by two theyre still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think theyre strange and when theyre dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the President - trick of the tail
Now they aint got a prayer - 100 years in jail

# 82 IRON MAIDEN - No Prayer For The Dying
There are times when Ive wondered
And times when Ive cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when Ive lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth
Now theres something to bet on
Youve got nothing to lose
When Ive sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end
God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being

# 83 IRON MAIDEN - Public Enema Number One
When it all comes down the line
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling Thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But youve got your fast bullet
One way ticket outta here
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
In the cities in the streets
Theres a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and Riots
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the Press get fed the scapegoats
Public Enema number one
A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I dont need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the Earth dies screaming

# 84 IRON MAIDEN - Fates Warning
Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that well die
How come the bullet hits the other guy
Do we have to try and reason why
Be it the Devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up youll know
Not just one power runs the show
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind

# 85 IRON MAIDEN - The Assassin
Now the contracts out
Theyve put the word about
Im coming after you
Its not the money I make
Its the thrill of the chase
And Im coming after you
I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think
Better watch out cos Im the Assassin
Better watch out Better watch out
Assassin
Im in a cold cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moments getting closer
And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running through my veins
Ive got you in my sights
Ive got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger
I feel adrenalin rush
Its just the final touch
You can kiss your arse goodbye

# 86 IRON MAIDEN - Run Silent Run Deep
The convoy lights are dead ahead
The Merchantmen lay in their bed
The trump of diesels hammers down
In the oily sea - the killing ground
His knuckles white his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil dont care
Running silent Running deep we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep a merchantmans nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent Running deep sink into your final sleep
Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver - men will die
A cast of millions - a part of play
Killer Victim or fool for a day
Obeying an order - men have to die
Us or them - a well rehearsed lie
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself - youre on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
Stern tubes ready Aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
But in two more weeks - dead like the rest

# 87 IRON MAIDEN - Hooks In You
I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my Green door theres nothing to see
Is that a feature what kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence laid
back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where shes bound
I dont like girls whove been hanging around
Hooks in you hooks in me hooks in the ceiling
For that well hung feeling
No big deal no big sin strung up on love I
Got the hooks screwed in
Shes tied up she cant come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed cos she aint home
Knock on wood - you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
Hooks in you Ive got those hooks in you
Hooks in you in you
Right on the money got it wrapped up tight
New ideas for the decor tonight
Gonna make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own

# 88 IRON MAIDEN - Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter
Honey its getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If theres some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
Youd better know that Im the one
So unchain your back door invite me around
Bring your daughter bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Honey its getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that Ill be waiting
Cos you know Im coming soon
So pick up your foolish pride no going back
No where no way no place to hide

# 89 IRON MAIDEN - Mother Russia
Mother Russia how are you sleeping
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow
Mother Russia poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your past
Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are free

# 90 MEGADEATH - Skin Omy Teeth
I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin omy teeth
My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck in time to see
The white lights a train
Bearing down on me
I wont feel the hurt
Im not trash any longer
That that doesnt kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
Thats what 911 is for
So tag my toe and dont forget
Ooh to close the drawer

# 91 MEGADEATH - Symphony Of Destruction
You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads aroll
Aroll
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony 
Of Destruction
Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes
The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
Awarring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall

# 92 MEGADEATH - Architecture Of Aggression
Born from the dark,
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below,
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy,
Hit them in their sleep,
And when all is won and lost,
The spoils of wars are yours to keep
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw blood and sweat,
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face a kiss
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass
A worldwide suicide
Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost
The spoils of war are yours to keep

# 93 MEGADEATH - Foreclosure Of A Dream
Rise so high yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Backed in a corner caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost
Personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Natures scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries loss of all pride
To leave aint believing so try and be tried
Insufficient funds insanity and suicide
Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed or dividend Some may ask Why
Youll find the solution the answers in the sky
Rise so high yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Holocaust

# 94 MEGADEATH - Sweating Bullets
Hello me  Meet the real me
And my misfits way of life
A dark black past is my
Most valued possessions
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back its still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story  Tell it to Readers Digest
Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend
Anxietys attacking me and
My air is getting thin
Im in trouble for the things
I havent got to yet
Im chomping at the bit and my
Palms are getting wet sweating bullets
Hello me  Its me again
You can subdue but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Thinking down to your level
Yea just keep on thinking its my fault
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
Mankind has got to know
His limitations
Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and
I dont know where Ive been
Im in trouble for the things
I havent got to yet
Im sharpening the axe and my
Palms are getting wet sweating bullets
Well me  Its nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its blacktooth grin
If the war inside my head
Wont take a day off Ill be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again
Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend
Anxietys attacking me and
And my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and
I dont know where Ive been
Once you committed me
Now youve acquitted me
Claiming validity
For your stupidity
Im chomping at the bit
Im sharpening the axe
Here I come again whoa
Sweating bullets

# 95 MEGADEATH - This Was My Life
It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do
Lying on your bed
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey This was my life
Hey This was my fate
This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin
Now theres motives for the suspect
Now theres nothing left to say
Now theres method to the madness
Now theres society to pay
In our life theres if
In our beliefs theres lie
In our business theres sin
In our bodies theres die
This was my life
This was my fate

# 96 MEGADEATH - Countdown To Extinction
Endangered species caged in fright
Shot in cold blood no chance to fight
The stage in set now pay the price
An ego boost dont think twice
Technology the battles unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man
Pseudo-safari the hunt is canned 
The hunt is canned
All are gone all but one
No contest nowhere to run
No more left only one
This is it this is the Countdown to Extinction
Tell the truth you wouldnt dare
The skin and thophy oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn
Liars anagram is lairs
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank youre so courageous 
So courageous
One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet
Forever  and the rate is accelerating

# 97 MEGADEATH - High Speed Dirt
Do it if you dare
Leaping from the sky
Hurling through the air
Exhilarating high
See the earth below
Soon to make a crater
Blue sky black death
Im off to meet my maker
Energy of the Gods adrenalin surge
Wont stop til I hit the ground Im on my way for sure
Up here in the air this will never hurt
Im on my way to impact taste the high speed dirt
Paralyzed with fear
Feel velocity gain
Entering a near
Catatonic state
Pressure of the sound
Roaring through my head
Crash into the ground
Damned if Ill be dead
Jump or Die
Dropping all my weight
Going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits
Like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins
Faster as I go
I forgot my name
Im a dirt torpedo
High Speed Dirt 

# 98 MEGADEATH - Psychotron
Assassin in stealth
Assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage
Computer on-board
Engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant
Maybe not a mutant maybe a man
Part bionic
And organic
Not a cyborg
Call him Psychotron
Burning inside
Godspeed in glide
Battle plan running
A killing machine
Just downright mean
And forever cunning
Maybe not a mutant maybe a man
Target to destroy
Arms in employ
Full assault fire threat
Sensors indicate
You will terminate
Life systems disconnect
Psychotron

# 99 MEGADEATH - Captive Honour
Madness comes and madness goes
An insane place with insane moves
Battles without for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up just breaking them in
Quickest way out quickest relief wins
Never disclose never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man youre a murderer
Kill many and youre a conqueror
Kill them all  Ooh  Oh youre a God
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury
Have you reached a verdict
Yes we have Your Honour we find the defendant Guilty
On all counts for crimes against all humanity
By virtue of the jurys decision and the power
Vested in me by the state I hereby sentence you to be
Incarcerated with no possibility of parole for life
Life  What do ya mean life  I aint got a life
Boy  Your soul better belong to Jesus 
Hmmm-mmm cause your ass belongs to me
Captive honour aint no honour
No time for questions
No time for the games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees youll lose
Captive honour aint no honour
Inside the big house
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guys now a bitch
Praying for death
It cant be worse than this
Captive honour aint no honour

# 100 MEGADEATH - Ashes In Your Mouth
People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall
Melting down all metals turning plows and sheats to swords
Shun words of the Bible we need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny that crooked schemer says the dead shall rise again
Where do we go from here
And should we really care
The end is finally here
God have mercy
Now weve rewritten history
The one thing weve found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth
If youre fighting to live
Its OK to die
The answer to your question is 
Welcome to tomorrow
Where do we go from here
God have mercy
